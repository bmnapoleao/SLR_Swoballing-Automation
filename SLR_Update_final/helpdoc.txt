1. create_dataset.py - extracts the Title and Abstract from the bibtex files 'Training-Included.bib' etc. and marks
   the relevance of the paper as 0 or 1 based on the label 'included' or 'excluded' in the file name. The output files
   generated by this are Training.csv and Testing.csv. These bibtex files were shared by an author of another paper.

2. SLR_update_ML.ipynb - it performs dataframe manipulation of the Training and Testing-test csv files, then text pre-
   processing, and finally experiments the following ML algorithms: Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost,
   SGD, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes algorithms: Multinomial, Bernoulli's, Complement, Gaussian. The best model is
   SGD, and following it is XGBoost.
