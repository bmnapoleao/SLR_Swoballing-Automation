 abstract = {A general method is presented for the synthesis of the folded-configuration coupling matrix for Chebyshev or other filtering functions of the most general kind, including the fully canonical case, i.e., N prescribed finite-position transmission zeros in an Nth-degree network. The method is based on the "N+2" transversal network coupling matrix, which is able to accommodate multiple input/output couplings, as well as the direct source-load coupling needed for the fully canonical cases. Firstly, the direct method for building up the coupling matrix for the transversal network is described. A simple non-optimization process is then outlined for the conversion of the transversal matrix to the equivalent "N+2" folded-configuration coupling matrix. The folded matrix may be used directly to realize microwave bandpass filters in a variety of technologies, but some of these could require awkward-to-realize cross-couplings. This paper concludes with a description of two simple procedures for transforming the transversal and folded matrices into two novel network configurations, which enable the realization of advanced microwave bandpass filters without the need for complex inter-resonator coupling elements.},

The methods are simpler and more general than the ones found in the literature. The polynomial synthesis approach is fully analytical and also very useful for lossless polynomial synthesis with simpler derivations. The coupling matrix synthesis method is based on a lossy transversal network model, which can also accommodate direct source to load coupling. Unlike the lossless transversal coupling matrix, the lossy coupling matrix model requires the assumption of complex J-inverters and additional resistive elements in the network. The complex J-inverter circuit model is defined and explained in detail in this paper. The lossy transversal N+2 matrix can be systematically rotated to obtain a number of practical realizations. Parallel-coupled pairs and folded lossy configurations are shown as examples. Moreover, the synthesis of novel networks with different return-loss levels at source and load is presented.

Due to its increasing portion of generation mix, wind farms are expected to play the role similar to the traditional power plants. Down the road toward this goal, the intermittency and uncertainty of wind are the two important factors that should be solved. Today, storage systems present a very interesting alternative to deal with the wind variability. Among various storage types, the hydrogen system is showing a promising future due to the high storage efficiency, low emissions, and wide applications. This paper presents a new coordination control scheme between the offshore wind farm and a hydrogen management system (HMS) for reducing the adverse impacts of wind variability. In the proposed scheme, the HMS is situated onshore to provide medium- to long-term energy balancing service. A supercapacitor bank is supplemented to the system for providing the short-term transient compensation. System configuration and control strategies are also presented. Simulation tests were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control. Test results indicate that the proposed control makes the wind farm be more flexible to satisfy the grid operation.},

The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to create multiple scenarios for representing the coordinated system uncertainties. The nonlinear natural gas network constraints are linearized and incorporated into the stochastic model. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of applying the hourly economic demand response for enhancing the scheduling coordination of natural gas and electricity networks. It is demonstrated that electricity demand response would offer a less volatile hourly load profile and locational marginal prices, and less dependence on natural gas constraints for the optimal operation of electric power systems.

 abstract = {The transient characteristics of load rejection process in pumped-storage hydropower (PSH) stations have a close relation to the safety of electric power system and hydraulic facilities. A large portion of PSHs consist of multiple units sharing one tunnel (MUSOT). In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical simulation method for hydraulic disturbance caused by single unit load rejection transition process based on the volume of fluid (VOF) two phase flow model was proposed and a filed test was carried out in a PSH station with a two units sharing one tunnel (TUSOT) setting. The power output from the unit that operates in normal condition (UNC), the pressure fluctuations of the spiral casing inlet and tailrace tunnel outlet, the water level variation and flow pattern in surge tank were obtained through the numerical simulation and field test. The results showed that the highest and lowest water level in surge tank from the numerical method agreed well with the measured data obtained in the field test. The guide vanes closing law of the unit that runs in load rejection (ULR) mainly impacts on the variation of the above parameters. To reduce the influence of single-load load-rejection hydraulic disturbance, a more elaborate guide vanes adjustment scheme of the UNC should be proposed in the next step to avoid large short-time fluctuations in the power output and pressure.},

 abstract = {With the increase of renewable energy in power system, the usage of a large number of converters brings safety and stability issues to power system, including lack of reliable inertia response, insufficient abilities for supporting current, voltage and frequency and lack of reliable damping to restrain oscillation. To solve these instability issues, the synchronous motor-generator pair (MGP) is proposed as a new method of grid-connection. Firstly, the main structure and application scene of MGP are analyzed. Secondly, the classical model for the MGP small signal stability is derived. Theoretical deduction proves that the MGP can provide more damping than a single generator with the same mass block. Then, 5kW MGP experimental system is built. The calculation parameters of the small signal model for the experimental system are determined by fitting experimental data repeatedly. On the basis, the calculated and measured frequency responses are compared under the same disturbance. The agreements between calculations and measurements show that the MGP small signal model can reflect damping and inertia level of MGP system. Finally, same disturbance experiment is carried out on a single-generator experimental system with the same mass block. The frequency response curves of the two modes under the same disturbance show that the MGP is more conducive to system stability.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a multi-objective dynamic economic dispatch model with renewable obligation requirements. The two objective functions that are presented in this paper aim to increase the level of renewable energy sources in the grid while minimising the total operating cost and respecting the spinning reserves required to maintain continuity of supply. The proposed model incorporates thermal power plants, photovoltaic and wind power plants into the grid. The paper presents a Pareto optimal solution which is a compromise between maximising the renewable energy source generation while minimising the operating costs. A renewable obligation policy is implemented in the proposed model to ensure that renewable energy source generators are utilised and any failure to attain the required renewable obligation is penalised in line with the renewable obligation framework. The proposed model is modified into a single objective optimisation problem and numerical tests are performed on the modified IEEE 24 RTS system and IEEE 118 bus system to test the effectiveness of the model. A comparative study evaluates the impact of the proposed model on the traditional dynamic economic dispatch in terms of the achieved renewable energy source penetration level and economic performance. The numerical simulations show that the proposed model is robust and can attain high renewable energy source penetration levels.},

 abstract = {Buildings are becoming smarter through the deployment of intelligent and energy-efficient technologies that reduce energy consumption while making buildings easier to manage and operate. Demand for lighting systems, efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as other types of hardware such as controls and sub-meters, is growing rapidly that needs more attention in terms of the energy efficiency. Moreover, the energy management of micro-generation or poly-generation system has always been very complex. Keeping the balance between demand and production is a challenging task for researchers. This paper investigates a simple yet very effective and intelligent demand response algorithm to mitigate the intermittency problem, providing an uninterrupted power supply to the users. The developed algorithm is fully capable of balancing the consumption and the production by controlling the user pre-defined load patterns that is based on the state of charge (SOC) of the storage system. The algorithm is tested on a microgrid system that consists of different loads, six photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, a small wind turbine system, and a set of lead-acid battery banks. The experimental result shows the maximum use of renewable energy while reducing the peak demand, cost of end-users and low or no carbon emissions. To achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption as well as to keep the balance between production and demand, this algorithm can be implemented for the efficient use of intermittent renewable energy sources.},

 abstract = {The multi-energy system (MES) provides a good environment for the local consumption of renewable energy such as wind and solar power because of its high operational flexibility. In the MES, the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of the battery and thermal storage tank plays an important role in enhancing reliability, economics, and operational flexibility. Hence, determining the optimal size of HESS in the MES is a critical problem but has not received enough attention. In light of this problem, this paper focuses on the optimal HESS planning problem in the community MES (CMES) under diverse uncertainties. Firstly, a two-stage stochastic planning model is proposed for the CMES to coordinate the optimal long-term HESS allocation and the short-term system operation. The thermal inertia in the heating network, space heating demand, and domestic hot water demand is utilized to reduce both the planning and operational cost. Secondly, a deterministic equivalence is proposed for the two-stage planning model to convert it into a mixed-integer linear programming model, which is then solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the HESS can enhance the operational flexibility of the CMES but only needs a very few investment costs and prove that the thermal inertia in the CMES can reduce the investment cost of HESS, the fuel, and the operational maintenance cost.},

The uncertainties associated with the RESs and loads are modeled using normal, Beta, and Weibull distribution functions. The simulation studies are performed in GAMS and MATLAB for 5 random days of a year. Although DRP increases the total profit of the MG, it can also increase the risk. The simulation results show that RIP is reduced when downside risk constraint (DRC) is considered along with DRP implementation.

 abstract = {The main obstacles of most renewable energies are their variability and availability; thus, we propose the ‘hydrogen option’ as a means of energy management, and we study its feasibility in a specific wind farm. The installation will be capable to store electrochemically the surplus energy and return the electricity to the grid during the peak hours. The solution was to connect the system, so that we store the energy as hydrogen when the wind generation exceeds a threshold; this is done by an electrolyzer set, with the appropriate nominal power, where, besides the electrical conversion devices, we have designed a control programme for tuning the voltage and current densities to the optimal operation of the cells. To utilize the hydrogen downstream the storage subsystem, we have selected a fuel-cell and the output is finally converted to the grid requirements.The nominal power of the wind farm studied is 48.8 MW, and it generates 18.4% of surplus electricity which cannot be evacuated through the node during the off-peak hours; this is converted into nearly 13 GWh of hydrogen per year, which can be used to produce peak electricity (raising the power of the hybrid system to 12.3%). Thus, it presents many advantages, which could facilitate the penetration of the wind resource, leading to a cleaner energy production and moving one step forward to the ‘hydrogen economy’.},

 abstract = {The optimal operation of active distribution systems in the presence of private renewable-based entities is one of the primary challenges of future power networks. In this regard, developing a practical framework to deal with this kind of issue is essential. Hence, in this paper, a novel bi-level stochastic programming approach is presented for optimal energy and reserve scheduling of the active distribution system in the presence of different eco-efficient autonomous players. In the proposed model, the distribution system operator, as a leader, attempts to minimize its total operating costs. At the same time, the renewable-based microgrid owner, as an independent follower, tends to maximize its profit from exchanging energy and reserve with the distribution system operator. The suggested scheme is a non-linear bi-level problem which is transformed into a non-linear single-level problem through Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. In order to find the global optima, the non-linear single-level problem is linearized by utilizing the Big-M method. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the provided model, it is tested on the modified IEEE 15-Bus active distribution system under different cases and scenarios. Obtained results indicate that the operation cost of the distribution system operator can be reduced up to 134.09$, from 10710.11$ to 10576.02$, and the profit of the microgrid owner can be increased significantly 906.93$, from 659.455$ to 1566.39$, by considering both environmentally friendly units, IPL and CAES.},

The flywheel energy storage system (FESS) based on a flywheel, an induction machine (IM) and an electronic power converter is associated with the wind generator via the DC bus.

In the literature, this control strategy has been frequently used for the two levels converter. The direct control of these systems has a purpose of eliminating the block of pulse width modulation and loops of regulations internal controlled variables, which gives a faster response. The use of switching table makes the system more efficient from the technical and economic view.

To obtain more practical distribution characteristics of salt-out particles in the steam turbine stage, the population balance model is loaded based on Eulerian multiphase model to simulate the real existed microscopic behaviors of salt-out particles such as nucleation, growth, aggregation and breakage. The results show that along the axial direction the number of salt-out particles gradually decreases and a ladder-like distribution is observed both on the stator and rotor blades. For the stator blade, a critical position which is 62.9% of the axial chord length occurs before which the diameter of salt-out particles on the pressure surface is greater than that on the suction surface, while after that the situation is opposite; for the rotor blade, a different critical position which is 81.1% of the axial chord length occurs. Along the axial direction the volume fraction of particles declines in the entrance area, fluctuates in the middle area on the stator blade, and on the pressure surface of rotor blade, a peak position of the volume fraction is consistent with the maximum turbulence intensity and particle diameter.},

On the other hand, the power system has faced excessive hardships for responding to the instant variations of demands. Meanwhile, storages could resolve the negative aspects of the demand’s variation. In this chapter, the selection of the storages is reviewed from cost efficiency and energy efficiency viewpoints.

Energy management system gathers data from smart meters every 15 min. As the pilot building location is in central Europe, complete energy self-sufficiency cannot be provided. The most problematic period of energy production with photovoltaic systems is winter. Solar radiation during the winter is much lower than in the summer and sometimes snow covers photovoltaic panels and disables energy production. Energy production and energy consumption are analyzed for one year. This study shows that complete self-sufficiency can be achieved by supplementing photovoltaic systems with hydrogen fuel cells. The amount of hydrogen, which would suffice for complete self-sufficiency for the whole period, is calculated according to the analyzed data. A synergy between photovoltaic system and hydrogen fuel cells is a step forward to complete self-sufficiency with renewable energy sources. The share of self-sufficiency of a hybrid PV fuel cell system would be 62.13%, meaning that there is no possibility for complete self-sufficiency from the pilot system. The shortage of hydrogen is 144.24 kg for one year and for achieving complete energy self-sufficiency, PV system should be bigger. A hybrid system with photovoltaic system, battery storage system and hydrogen fuel cells can be a solution for complete self-sufficiency. From an economic point of view, such systems are accessible for commercial use. The initial investment is relatively high, because of the high cost of the hydrogen storage tank.},

Calculations based on the optimization mathematical model demonstrated the efficiency of the combined use of wind and solar energy in the considered areas, as well as the simultaneous storage of electric energy and hydrogen. The electric energy storage is most efficient for short-term time intervals whereas an increase in the duration of continuous energy “standstills” up to several days makes the storage of hydrogen more cost-effective.},

 abstract = {These days, a new concept called intelligent parking lot (IPL) has been extensively paid consideration to be used in power system industry. Using charge/discharge of electric vehicles (EV), IPLs attempt to exchange power with the upstream grid. In addition to IPL, studied model involves non-renewable and renewable units such as wind turbine, photovoltaic (PV) system, local dispatchable generator (LDG) like micro-turbine and hydrogen storage system (HSS) which are used all together to satisfy energy demand. In this work, optimal scheduling of an IPL has been studied under time-of-use (TOU) rate of demand response program (DRP) in which price of upstream gird is set to be uncertain which uncertainty is modeled via interval optimization technique. This technique transforms uncertainty based model into a deterministic multi-objective model with deviation and average costs as the inconsistency objective functions. Then, applying ε-constraint technique and fuzzy approach, mentioned multi-objective problem is solved. Obtained Pareto results as well as selected trade-off results in various case studies have been compared to prove efficiency of employed techniques. Obtained results revealed that due to positive influence of DRP, increase of average cost of IPL has been reduced up to 2.46% while deviation cost of IPL has been decreased up to 12.49%.},

@article{Mirzaei_2019,
 abstract = {Because of highly increasing energy consumption, environmental issues and lack of common energy sources, the use of renewable energy sources especially wind power generation technology is increasing with significant growth in the world. But due to the variable nature of these sources, new challenges have been created in the balance between production and consumption of power system. The hydrogen energy storage (HES) system by storing excess wind power through the technology of power to hydrogen (P2H) and delivering it to the electricity network through hydrogen-based gas turbine at the required hours reduces not only wind alternation but can play an important role in balancing power production and consumption. On the other hand, power consumers by participating in demand response (DR) programs can reduce their consumption at peak load or wind power shortage hours, and increase their consumption at low-load or excess wind power hours to reduce wind power spillage and system energy cost. This paper proposes a stochastic security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with wind energy considering coordinated operation of price-based DR and HES system. Price-based DR has been formulated as a price responsive shiftable demand bidding mechanism. The proposed model has been tested on modified 6-bus and 24-bus systems. The numerical results show the effect of simultaneous consideration of HES system and price-based DR integrated with wind energy on hourly generation scheduling of thermal units. As a result there is some reduction in wind generation power spillage and daily operation cost.},

@article{Snyder_2006,
 abstract = {Many objectives have been proposed for optimization under uncertainty. The typical stochastic programming ob-jective of minimizing expected cost may yield solutions that are inexpensive in the long run but perform poorly under certain realizations of the random data. On the other hand, the typical robust optimization objective of minimizing maximum cost or regret tends to be overly conservative, planning against a disastrous but unlikely scenario. In this paper, we present facility location models that combine the two objectives by minimizing the expected cost while bounding the relative regret in each scenario. In particular, the models seek the minimum-expected-cost solution that is p-robust; i.e., whose relative regret is no more than 100p% in each scenario. We present p-robust models based on two classical facility location problems, the P -median problem and the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem. We solve both problems using variable splitting (Lagrangian decomposition), in which the subproblem reduces to the multiple-choice knapsack problem. Feasible solutions are found using an upper-bounding heuristic. For many instances of the problems, finding a feasible solution, and even determining whether the instance is feasible, is difficult; we discuss a mechanism for determining infeasibility. We also show how the algorithm can be used as a heuristic to solve minimax-regret versions of the location problems.},

 abstract = {Wind power, the most promising renewable energy source in the world, plays an important role in the electricity markets. Wind power curtailment cannot be avoided in some countries due to its output has a special feature of randomness and volatility. Since the excess wind power being converted into hydrogen and sold to the hydrogen market will be the future trend. This study proposes a wind-electrolytic hydrogen storage system to participate in the electricity/hydrogen markets for selling electricity and hydrogen, which can help to improve the benefits of wind power in the electricity markets and addree the wind power curtailment effectively. With considering the uncertainties of wind power outputs and electricity prices, the optimal operation strategy is proposed with the objective of maximizing profits. The scenario-based stochastic method is adopted to describe the uncertainties, and the financial risk is evaluated using conditional value-at-risk. The operational problem of the proposed system is formulated into a mixed-integer linear programming model. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed operational strategy is validated by a case study. The results show that the expected revenue increases with the increase of the hydrogen selling price, indicating that investors can obtain profits by converting electricity into hydrogen. The optimal expected revenue increases by 33.42% when hydrogen price increases from 1.2 DKK/kWh to 1.8 DKK/kWh and the risk factor is equal to 0. Based on the analysis of the results, the importance of hydrogen can be proven.},

The Demand Response Resources (DRRs) can be considered as one of the most important demand side options which have been developed as an aftermath of DRPs implementation. In this paper, based on benefit function concept of customers and flexible demand elasticity, a dynamic economic model of DRPs as a combination of EDRP and TOU programs is developed. Different alternatives of DRPs are developed in which the independent system operator can choose the optimal DRP which reflects its perspectives. To do so, the Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) is employed as an effective method. In addition, entropy methods and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are utilized to prioritize various developed DRPs. To cover all operating conditions, the numerical studies are provided on a standard IEEE ten-unit test system taking from both “load profile characteristics” and “economical” points of view into account and considering different indices as peak to valley distance, peak reduction, etc. Based on obtained results, the developed model can be utilized to improve satisfaction of customers and the load profile characteristics.},

 abstract = {Abstract Virtual synchronous generator technology can effectively improve the anti‐interference characteristics of the system frequency and bus voltage in the microgrid, and solve the problems of insufficient damping and low inertia of the system. However, in an islanded microgrid with multiple distributed generation, the difference in line impedance will cause local voltage deviations, which in turn leads to a series of problems, such as reducing power distribution accuracy and increasing bus voltage drop. Therefore, for the island‐type microgrid multi‐inverter distributed power generation parallel system, in order to solve the problem of low power distribution accuracy and large frequency oscillation caused by system parameters in virtual synchronous generator control, an improved virtual synchronous generator control algorithm based on adaptive droop coefficient is proposed in this paper, which not only eliminates the resistance component of the line impedance, makes the system impedance characteristic present a purely inductive nature, but also realises real‐time adjustment of active and reactive power. While maintaining the stability of the bus voltage and system frequency, it maintains high power distribution accuracy and improves the dynamic performance and operational stability of the power grid system.},

Typically such filters have to be manufactured in large quantities at lowest possible cost. However, because of the asymmetric filtering characteristics, the designs often include diagonal cross couplings between non-adjacent resonators In addition to the usual 'straight' couplings. Diagonal couplings tend to be mechanically difficult to manufacture and assemble, can be electrically awkward to tune and be sensitive to temperature, vibration etc. all of which drives up unit costs again. This paper introduces the methods for the synthesis of two novel filter network configurations which do not require diagonal couplings, but which nonetheless are able to realize asymmetric filtering functions.},

The approximation process leads to network functions defined by polynomials containing complex coefficients. It is shown that these functions can be handled with available synthesis procedures, if suitable modifications are made. This technique is based upon the properties of quasi-Hurwitz polynomials, treated in the Appendix.

These are illustrated by several numerical examples. Next, the paper deals with the design of filters, taking into consideration additional requirements involving the group delay. Possibilities of solving the problem are described. An actual example, together with the measured results, illustrates the excellent agreement between the theoretical determination and the behavior of the filter constructed accordingly.

The element values of the direct-coupled filter are related directly to the step impedances of the prototype whose values have been tabulated. The theory gives close agreement with computed data over a range of parameters as specified by a very simple formula. The design technique is convenient for practical applications.},

 abstract = {A new approximation theory is presented for a low-pass prototype filter which simultaneously optimizes both the passband amplitude and phase response of the scattering transfer coefficient over the same finite band. This closed form solution is expressed in terms of single polynomial, which is readily generated through a simple recurrence formula, and has been termed the equidistant linear phase polynomial since its phase deviation from linearity vanishes at equidistant points along the real frequency axis. A synthesis procedure is presented for the realization of this transfer function using a resistively terminated, symmetrical, lossless, two-port network where extensive use is made of the immittance inverter concept. The even-mode admittance, which defines the network, possesses a simple closed form representation in terms of the equidistant linear phase polynomial and its derivative, and consequently, the entire theory is derived in an analytic form. Typical performance characteristics are graphically presented for networks of up to 14th degree, illustrating the superiority of this new approach over any other known form of approximation theory for selective linear phase filters.},

It is demonstrated that this gives much improved skirt selectivity in the case of a finite frequency pole, making it a viable intermediate case between the Chebyshev and elliptic function filters, while in the case of real-frequency zeros, very flat group delay over 50 percent of the passband is achieved with minimal cost in insertion loss and skirt rejection.

@article{1266901,
 abstract = {This paper introduces building blocks for modular design of elliptic, pseudoelliptic, and self-equalized filters. The first building block is of second order and generates two transmission zeros (TZs), which are either on the real or imaginary axis. Moving the zeros from the real axis (linear phase response) to the imaginary axis (attenuation poles) requires changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. The second building block is a structure of order three, called extended doublet, which allows the generation of two TZs practically anywhere in the complex plane. An important property of this block is its ability to move the two TZs from the real axis to the imaginary axis of the complex s-plane without changing the signs of its coupling coefficients. The third building block is of third order and generates two TZs, which can be moved from the real to the imaginary axis by changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. Simple waveguide structures to implement these blocks are introduced for validation, although this general approach is feasible for all resonator filter types. Higher order filters are designed modularly by cascading an arbitrary number of these building blocks. A novel concept, which allows the independent control of each pair of TZs in higher order filters, is then introduced. It is shown that the new concept allows a filter of order N to generate N TZs without directly coupling the source to the load even when the coupling coefficients are all assumed frequency independent. The same approach can be used to design and reduce the sensitivity of higher order elliptic and pseudoelliptic filters using other building blocks such as doublets or a mixture of building blocks of different orders and properties. Measured results and extensive computer simulation are presented to demonstrate the validity of the concept and the performance of the designed filters.},

The method relies on the fact that the coupling elements can be made into perfect impedance inverters, or "quarter-wave" transformers, by the addition of negative elements in lumped-constant circuits, or of short negative lengths of line in waveguide and transmission-line circuits. Specific design formulas are given for filters constructed of lumped-constant elements, waveguide, and strip or other TEM transmission line, and for pass band response functions of the maximally flat and Tchebycheff types. The formulas include a simple frequency transformation that corrects for the frequency sensitivity of the coupling reactances, and thereby greatly improves the design accuracy for both lumpedconstant and microwave types when the bandwidth is more than a few per cent. Exact response curves computed from typical filter designs are compared to the prototype-function response curves, and it is shown that the design formulas give good results with bandwidths of at least 20 per cent in guide wavelength in the case of waveguide filters, or 20 per cent in frequency for TEM-mode transmission-line and lumped-constant filters.},

 abstract = {In this paper a new approach to the synthesis of coupling matrices for microwave filters is presented. The new approach represents an advance on existing direct and optimization methods for coupling matrix synthesis, in that it will exhaustively discover all possible coupling matrix solutions for a network if more than one exists. This enables a selection to be made of the set of coupling values, resonator frequency offsets, parasitic coupling tolerance, etc. that will be best suited to the technology it is intended to realize the microwave filter with. To demonstrate the use of the method, the case of the recently introduced “extended box” coupling matrix configuration is taken. The extended box is a new class of filter configuration adapted to the synthesis of asymmetric filtering characteristics of any degree. For this configuration the number of solutions to the coupling matrix synthesis problem appears to be high and offers therefore some flexibility that can be used during the design phase. We illustrate this by carrying out the synthesis process of two asymmetric filters of 8th and 10th degree. In the first example a ranking criterion is defined in anticipation of a dual mode realization and allows the selection of a “best” coupling matrix out of 16 possible ones. For the 10th degree filter a new technique of approximate synthesis is presented, yielding some simplifications of the practical realization of the filter as well as of its computer aided tuning phase. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A computationally efficient method is employed for evaluating reflection and transmission polynomials, given the transmission zeros; then, the synthesis of a starting coupling matrix is performed using one of the methods available in the literature. The desired inline topology is then assembled by cascading elementary building blocks (triplets and/or quadruplets), following specific rules which assure the feasibility of the structure; finally, the synthesis is performed by applying a multiple similarity transform to the starting coupling matrix (the set of rotation angles is determined by means of an efficient and fast optimization procedure).

Such an inverse problem arises in many applications where parameters of a certain physical system are to be deter-mined from the knowledge or expectation of its dynamical behavior. Spectral information is entailed because the dynamical behavior often is governed by the underlying natural frequencies and normal modes. Structural stipulation is designated because the physical system often is subject to some feasibil-ity constraints. The spectral data involved may consist of complete or only partial information on eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The structure the matri-ces embodied can take many forms. The objective of an inverse eigenvalue problem is to construct a matrix that maintains both the specific structure as well the given spectral property.

A simple lossy synthesis technique using any synthesized lossless (nontransversal) filter was shown, which can be used with hyperbolic rotations for loss distribution. Moreover, the limitation on the minimum Q of lossy resonators has been studied using a one-pole filter as a fundamental building block. Lossy four-pole Chebyshev and quasi-elliptic synthesis examples were presented. A four- pole Chebyshev lossy filter in the Ku band has been synthesized, modeled, and fabricated successfully using mixed combline and microstrip technologies. The design has the advantage of having all input-output paths going through more than one resonator, which minimizes unwanted source-to-load coupling, especially at high frequencies. The lossy approach is still at its early stages of development and needs more research and development effort to become as mature as the predistorted filters.},

A synthesis procedure is presented for the realization of this transfer function using a resistively terminated, symmetrical, lossless, two-port network where extensive use is made of the immittance inverter concept. The even-mode admittance, which defines the network, possesses a simple closed form representation in terms of the equidistant linear phase polynomial and its derivative, and consequently, the entire theory is derived in an analytic form.

The approach is based on repeated analyses of a circuit with the desired topology; no similarity transformation is needed. Restrictions imposed by the implementation on the coupling coefficients such as signs and orders of magnitudes are straightforwardly handled within this technique. The technique is then used to synthesize and design filters with full or almost full coupling matrices by selecting, among the infinite number of solutions, the matrix that corresponds to the actual implementation. In such cases, analytical techniques and those based on similarity transformations cannot be used since they provide no mechanism to constrain individual coupling coefficients in order to discriminate between two full coupling matrices, which are both solutions to the synthesis problem. Using the technique described in this paper, a filter designer can extract the coupling matrix of a filter of arbitrary order and topology while enforcing relevant constraints. There is no need to master all the different existing similarity-transformation-based techniques and the topologies to which they are applicable. For the first time, detailed investigations of parasitic coupling effects, for either compensation or utilization, are made possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of a variety of filters, some of which are then designed and built and their response measured.},
