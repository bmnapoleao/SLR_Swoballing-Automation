 abstract = {A multilayer bandpass filter with high selectivity is proposed in this letter. Discriminating coupling formed by slot-coupled quarter-wavelength and half-wavelength resonators introduces a zero at 3f0 (f0 is the center frequency) and the second harmonic is also suppressed due to the quarter-wavelength resonators. Owing to multilayer structure, source-load coupling is introduced to improve selectivity. Then an extra coupled line path is added with the same amplitude as the discriminating coupling path while they are out of phase. Thus signal cancellation produces three extra transmission zeros, with the selectivity and suppression performance further improved. To validate the design, a prototype bandpass filter centered at 2.49 GHz with 3 dB fractional bandwidth of 8.1% is fabricated. Both simulated and measured results are in good agreement and show good performance of the proposed bandpass filter.},

@article{Fathi_2022,
 abstract = {This study presents a novel multilayer structure of parallel coupled-line bandpass filtercentered at 2.42 GHz with a fractional bandwidth value of approximately 19.4%. The designed filter can suppress harmonics with an appropriate frequency response by incorporating different techniques based on the multilayer technique. A combination of different techniques such as radial microstrip stubs and defected ground structure (DGS) and defected microstrip structure techniques are employed to suppress harmonics up to 5f0. These techniques are used in two layers to suppress up to 5f0. In addition, in this study, the effects of different parameters, such as the width of slot-line DGS, the angle of diagonal line slots in the upper layer, and the air gap between the two layers on the filter performance, are investigated. To verify the correct circuit operation, the designed filter is implemented and tested. The measurement results of the proposed filter are compared with the simulation results.},
