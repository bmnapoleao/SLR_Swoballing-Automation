 abstract = {A general method is presented for the synthesis of the folded-configuration coupling matrix for Chebyshev or other filtering functions of the most general kind, including the fully canonical case, i.e., N prescribed finite-position transmission zeros in an Nth-degree network. The method is based on the "N+2" transversal network coupling matrix, which is able to accommodate multiple input/output couplings, as well as the direct source-load coupling needed for the fully canonical cases. Firstly, the direct method for building up the coupling matrix for the transversal network is described. A simple non-optimization process is then outlined for the conversion of the transversal matrix to the equivalent "N+2" folded-configuration coupling matrix. The folded matrix may be used directly to realize microwave bandpass filters in a variety of technologies, but some of these could require awkward-to-realize cross-couplings. This paper concludes with a description of two simple procedures for transforming the transversal and folded matrices into two novel network configurations, which enable the realization of advanced microwave bandpass filters without the need for complex inter-resonator coupling elements.},

 abstract = {In this paper, novel approaches to synthesize admittance function polynomials and canonical N+2 coupling matrices for narrowband lossy filters are presented. The methods are simpler and more general than the ones found in the literature. The polynomial synthesis approach is fully analytical and also very useful for lossless polynomial synthesis with simpler derivations. The coupling matrix synthesis method is based on a lossy transversal network model, which can also accommodate direct source to load coupling. Unlike the lossless transversal coupling matrix, the lossy coupling matrix model requires the assumption of complex J-inverters and additional resistive elements in the network. The complex J-inverter circuit model is defined and explained in detail in this paper. The lossy transversal N+2 matrix can be systematically rotated to obtain a number of practical realizations. Parallel-coupled pairs and folded lossy configurations are shown as examples. Moreover, the synthesis of novel networks with different return-loss levels at source and load is presented. A performance comparison with a predistorted filter is also included in this paper.},

However, because of the asymmetric filtering characteristics, the designs often include diagonal cross couplings between non-adjacent resonators In addition to the usual 'straight' couplings. Diagonal couplings tend to be mechanically difficult to manufacture and assemble, can be electrically awkward to tune and be sensitive to temperature, vibration etc. all of which drives up unit costs again.

The synthesis proceeds in three steps: approximation, representation by means of fictitious network elements in the low-pass domain, and subsequent low-pass, band-pass transformation. The approximation process leads to network functions defined by polynomials containing complex coefficients. It is shown that these functions can be handled with available synthesis procedures, if suitable modifications are made. This technique is based upon the properties of quasi-Hurwitz polynomials, treated in the Appendix. These procedures then lead to a network representation in the low-pass domain, which includes two fictitious network elements, namely constant positive or negative imaginary quantities. After a low-pass, band-pass transformation has been applied the network becomes physically realizable.

 abstract = {Following an introduction to the methods and significance of filter design, this paper deals with definitions and filter synthesis according to prescribed attenuation requirements. It shows how the characteristic function for cases of practical importance can be calculated, particularly for the special cases 1) where this function is a power term in the frequency variable (maximally flat), 2) where it is a Tchebycheff polynomial function, and 3) where the effective attenuation in both the pass band and the stop band is of Tchebycheff character, and, also for 4) the general case of Tchebycheff behavior in the pass band with prescribed attenuation poles. The way, and the separate steps, of the determination of the circuit-element values for the realization of reactance ladder-network filters without mutual inductances are indicated, and the various necessary computation formulas are described. For the first two special cases mentioned above, computation formulas applicable in general are given. New formulas are presented for the transformation of a low-pass into a band-pass configuration with a minimum number of inductances, and into a band-pass with the stray capacitance being taken into consideration. These are illustrated by several numerical examples. Next, the paper deals with the design of filters, taking into consideration additional requirements involving the group delay.

A synthesis procedure is presented for the realization of this transfer function using a resistively terminated, symmetrical, lossless, two-port network where extensive use is made of the immittance inverter concept. The even-mode admittance, which defines the network, possesses a simple closed form representation in terms of the equidistant linear phase polynomial and its derivative, and consequently, the entire theory is derived in an analytic form. Typical performance characteristics are graphically presented for networks of up to 14th degree, illustrating the superiority of this new approach over any other known form of approximation theory for selective linear phase filters.},

@article{1266901,
 abstract = {This paper introduces building blocks for modular design of elliptic, pseudoelliptic, and self-equalized filters. The first building block is of second order and generates two transmission zeros (TZs), which are either on the real or imaginary axis. Moving the zeros from the real axis (linear phase response) to the imaginary axis (attenuation poles) requires changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. The second building block is a structure of order three, called extended doublet, which allows the generation of two TZs practically anywhere in the complex plane. An important property of this block is its ability to move the two TZs from the real axis to the imaginary axis of the complex s-plane without changing the signs of its coupling coefficients. The third building block is of third order and generates two TZs, which can be moved from the real to the imaginary axis by changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. Simple waveguide structures to implement these blocks are introduced for validation, although this general approach is feasible for all resonator filter types. Higher order filters are designed modularly by cascading an arbitrary number of these building blocks. A novel concept, which allows the independent control of each pair of TZs in higher order filters, is then introduced. It is shown that the new concept allows a filter of order N to generate N TZs without directly coupling the source to the load even when the coupling coefficients are all assumed frequency independent. The same approach can be used to design and reduce the sensitivity of higher order elliptic and pseudoelliptic filters using other building blocks such as doublets or a mixture of building blocks of different orders and properties. Measured results and extensive computer simulation are presented to demonstrate the validity of the concept and the performance of the designed filters.},

The method relies on the fact that the coupling elements can be made into perfect impedance inverters, or "quarter-wave" transformers, by the addition of negative elements in lumped-constant circuits, or of short negative lengths of line in waveguide and transmission-line circuits. Specific design formulas are given for filters constructed of lumped-constant elements, waveguide, and strip or other TEM transmission line, and for pass band response functions of the maximally flat and Tchebycheff types. The formulas include a simple frequency transformation that corrects for the frequency sensitivity of the coupling reactances, and thereby greatly improves the design accuracy for both lumpedconstant and microwave types when the bandwidth is more than a few per cent. Exact response curves computed from typical filter designs are compared to the prototype-function response curves, and it is shown that the design formulas give good results with bandwidths of at least 20 per cent in guide wavelength in the case of waveguide filters, or 20 per cent in frequency for TEM-mode transmission-line and lumped-constant filters.},

 abstract = {In this paper a new approach to the synthesis of coupling matrices for microwave filters is presented. The new approach represents an advance on existing direct and optimization methods for coupling matrix synthesis, in that it will exhaustively discover all possible coupling matrix solutions for a network if more than one exists. This enables a selection to be made of the set of coupling values, resonator frequency offsets, parasitic coupling tolerance, etc. that will be best suited to the technology it is intended to realize the microwave filter with. To demonstrate the use of the method, the case of the recently introduced “extended box” coupling matrix configuration is taken. The extended box is a new class of filter configuration adapted to the synthesis of asymmetric filtering characteristics of any degree. For this configuration the number of solutions to the coupling matrix synthesis problem appears to be high and offers therefore some flexibility that can be used during the design phase. We illustrate this by carrying out the synthesis process of two asymmetric filters of 8th and 10th degree. In the first example a ranking criterion is defined in anticipation of a dual mode realization and allows the selection of a “best” coupling matrix out of 16 possible ones. For the 10th degree filter a new technique of approximate synthesis is presented, yielding some simplifications of the practical realization of the filter as well as of its computer aided tuning phase. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Such an inverse problem arises in many applications where parameters of a certain physical system are to be deter-mined from the knowledge or expectation of its dynamical behavior. Spectral information is entailed because the dynamical behavior often is governed by the underlying natural frequencies and normal modes. Structural stipulation is designated because the physical system often is subject to some feasibil-ity constraints. The spectral data involved may consist of complete or only partial information on eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The structure the matri-ces embodied can take many forms. The objective of an inverse eigenvalue problem is to construct a matrix that maintains both the specific structure as well the given spectral property.

A simple lossy synthesis technique using any synthesized lossless (nontransversal) filter was shown, which can be used with hyperbolic rotations for loss distribution. Moreover, the limitation on the minimum Q of lossy resonators has been studied using a one-pole filter as a fundamental building block. Lossy four-pole Chebyshev and quasi-elliptic synthesis examples were presented. A four- pole Chebyshev lossy filter in the Ku band has been synthesized, modeled, and fabricated successfully using mixed combline and microstrip technologies. The design has the advantage of having all input-output paths going through more than one resonator, which minimizes unwanted source-to-load coupling, especially at high frequencies. The lossy approach is still at its early stages of development and needs more research and development effort to become as mature as the predistorted filters.},

 abstract = {The paper presents a universal and comprehensive synthesis technique of coupled resonator filters with source/load-multiresonator coupling. The approach is based on repeated analyses of a circuit with the desired topology; no similarity transformation is needed. Restrictions imposed by the implementation on the coupling coefficients such as signs and orders of magnitudes are straightforwardly handled within this technique. The technique is then used to synthesize and design filters with full or almost full coupling matrices by selecting, among the infinite number of solutions, the matrix that corresponds to the actual implementation. In such cases, analytical techniques and those based on similarity transformations cannot be used since they provide no mechanism to constrain individual coupling coefficients in order to discriminate between two full coupling matrices, which are both solutions to the synthesis problem. Using the technique described in this paper, a filter designer can extract the coupling matrix of a filter of arbitrary order and topology while enforcing relevant constraints. There is no need to master all the different existing similarity-transformation-based techniques and the topologies to which they are applicable. For the first time, detailed investigations of parasitic coupling effects, for either compensation or utilization, are made possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of a variety of filters, some of which are then designed and built and their response measured.},

 abstract = {An inverse eigenvalue problem concerns the reconstruction of a structured matrix from prescribed spectral data. Such an inverse problem arises in many applications where parameters of a certain physical system are to be deter-mined from the knowledge or expectation of its dynamical behavior. Spectral information is entailed because the dynamical behavior often is governed by the underlying natural frequencies and normal modes. Structural stipulation is designated because the physical system often is subject to some feasibil-ity constraints. The spectral data involved may consist of complete or only partial information on eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The structure the matri-ces embodied can take many forms. The objective of an inverse eigenvalue problem is to construct a matrix that maintains both the specific structure as well the given spectral property. In this expository paper the emphasis is to provide an overview of the vast scope of this intriguing problem, treating some of its many applications, its mathematical properties, and a variety of numerical techniques.},

 abstract = {A new approximation theory is presented for a low-pass prototype filter which simultaneously optimizes both the passband amplitude and phase response of the scattering transfer coefficient over the same finite band. This closed form solution is expressed in terms of single polynomial, which is readily generated through a simple recurrence formula, and has been termed the equidistant linear phase polynomial since its phase deviation from linearity vanishes at equidistant points along the real frequency axis. A synthesis procedure is presented for the realization of this transfer function using a resistively terminated, symmetrical, lossless, two-port network where extensive use is made of the immittance inverter concept. The even-mode admittance, which defines the network, possesses a simple closed form representation in terms of the equidistant linear phase polynomial and its derivative, and consequently, the entire theory is derived in an analytic form. Typical performance characteristics are graphically presented for networks of up to 14th degree, illustrating the superiority of this new approach over any other known form of approximation theory for selective linear phase filters.},

Constraints on the scattering parameters of lossless, time-invariant, and reciprocal two-port networks, expressed as rational functions of the physical frequency, are presented. Filtering functions exhibiting arbitrarily positioned transmission zeros and locally symmetric or asymmetric responses with respect to the center of the passband, and satisfying these constraints are then introduced. A direct synthesis technique to extract the elements of the transversal equivalent circuit to yield a prescribed response is presented. Response-preserving similarity transformations are then applied to the circuit to force a desired topology. As opposed to the prevailing narrowband approximation, any topology other than the transversal will have off-diagonal elements that depend on frequency. Interesting features that are not found in the narrowband approximation are reported. Examples demonstrating the soundness of the theory are presented.},

Two cost functions are constructed from the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix and its principal submatrices or at specially selected frequencies involving the values S11 and S21. The values of non-zero elements of the coupling matrix are found using solvopt and fmincon to minimize the cost functions. With the initial coupling matrix synthesized in a tridiagonal form by solving the Jacobi inverse eigenvalue problem, the proposed method provides fast convergence and good accuracy to find the final solution. In addition, as the hybrid method may be run from random initial variables whose values lie within specified limits, it has the potential to be used for series of coupling matrix synthesis problems.

The method enables many potential applications of an almost abandoned technique, and permits a lower Q implementation technology to emulate the performance of a higher Q filter. 10-4-4 filters were built and tested at C- and Ku-band to verify the validity of the new method. The impact to satellite communication channels was also analyzed. Another novel concept of over-predistortion was proposed and evaluated and should lead to significant improvement for applications such as satellite transponder input multiplexers, where insertion loss can be traded off for in-band flatness, mass, volume, and even overall system performance.},

It is shown that the signs of the coupling coefficients to produce a transmission zero (TZ) either below or above the passband are, in certain situations, reversed from the predictions of simpler existing models. In particular, the bypass coupling to higher/lower order modes must be significantly stronger than the coupling to the main resonance in order to generate TZs in the immediate vicinity of the passband. Planar (H-plane) singlets are used to illustrate the derived results. This study should provide very important guidelines in selecting the proper main and bypass couplings for sophisticated filtering structures.

A well-known equivalence between open circuited, quarter wavelength high-impedance stubs, and capacitively coupled short-circuited stubs of lower impedance, is used iteratively to achieve a design with some innovative features: The shunt stubs are all the same impedance; typically; 50 /spl Omega/. The series 90 degree coupling lines are also the same impedance (again typically 50 /spl Omega/). Dimensions and components may thus be easily selected for high-power and low-loss operation. The coupling capacitors (which are in series with the stubs) are adjustable without compromising Q. Re-entrant stubs are used which allow a mixed lumped-distributed stub response and easy adjustment of stub lengths. A rugged coaxial construction is adopted with nothing cantilevered or unsupported. These features result in a design which is quite compact, tunable over a wide range of center frequencies, allows for adjustable bandwidth and thus selectivity, while intrinsically exhibiting high-power capability, low passband loss, and suitability for operation in demanding environments.<>},

It is based on the evaluation of the characteristic polynomials of the diplexer including the three-port junction connecting the TX and RX filters (two types of junctions are considered, suitable for waveguide and coaxial diplexers modeling). The novel method is particularly suited for small separation between the two diplexer channels: as known, this is the most difficult case in the diplexers design, due to the strong interaction between the TX and RX filters. The proposed synthesis approach offers noticeable design flexibility, as it allows the synthesis of the two composing filters independently of their connections to the diplexer, taking into account at the same time the interaction produced in the diplexer junction. Moreover the choice of the filters topology is absolutely arbitrary (the number of poles and the transmission zeros of the two filters have to be specified).

The inverter coupled resonator section is first investigated, and then a dual-passband Chebyshev filter, a triple-passband Chebyshev filter, and a dual-passband quasi-elliptic filter, which consist of the inverter coupled resonator sections, are synthesized from the generalized low-pass prototypes having Chebyshev or quasi-elliptic responses, respectively. Subsequently, theses filters with a symmetric response are designed and implemented using the substrate integrated waveguide scheme over the -band frequency range. The inverter coupled resonator sections composed of side-by-side horizontally oriented substrate integrated waveguide cavities are coupled, in turn, by post-wall irises. 50-Omega microstrip lines are used to directly excite the filters. Measured results are presented and compared to those simulated by Ansoft's High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software package. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results is observed, which has also validated the proposed concept of design and synthesis with the substrate integration technology.},

 abstract = {Following a brief review of different types of multiplexer configurations, a systematic design approach has been outlined for the design of manifold-coupled multiplexers. The piecewise approach, optimizing parts of the multiplexer separately in repeated cycles while converging upon an optimal solution, has proved to be very effective for most practical applications. The technique is readily applicable to manifold multiplexers incorporating an arbitrary number of channels, regardless of their bandwidths and channel separations. There are no restrictions on the design and implementation of channel filters onto the manifold; they may be asymmetric, and may incorporate transmission zeros, group delay equalization zeros, or both. The manifold itself is a transmission line, be it a coaxial line or a rectangular waveguide or some other low-loss structure. The costly EM simulation is used economically on manifold junctions and channel filters through the use of space-mapping optimization techniques, where EM-based simulators are used to fine-model each multiplexer channel and coupling matrix representation is used to coarse-model the performance. Fine details such as tuning screws may be included in the design process. This design procedure takes into account the effects of dispersion and spurious modes and, as a result, the overall design and final tuning time can be significantly reduced.},

However, it is usually difficult to implement the negative coupling structure required for the design of compact canonical folded elliptic or quasi-elliptic cross-coupled bandpass filter on the basis of a single-layer SIW. In this paper, a special planar negative coupling scheme including a magnetic coupling post-wall iris and a balanced microstrip line with a pair of metallic via-holes is studied in detail. Two -band fourth-degree cross-coupled bandpass filters without and with source-load coupling using the negative coupling structures are then proposed and designed. The two novel SIW filters having the same center frequency of 20.5 GHz and respective passband width of 700 and 800 MHz are implemented on a single-layer Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 substrate with thickness of 0.508 mm. Measured results of those filters, which exhibit a high selectivity, and a minimum in-band insertion loss of approximately 0.9 and 1.0 dB, respectively, agree well with simulated results.},

 abstract = {A substrate integrated waveguide with square complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) etched on the waveguide surface is investigated in this paper. The proposed structures allow the implementation of a forward-wave passband propagating below the characteristic cutoff frequency of the waveguide. By changing the orientations of the CSRRs, which are incorporated in the waveguide surface and can be interpreted in terms of electric dipoles, varied passband characteristics are observed. A detailed explanation for the generation and variations of the passbands has been illuminated. The application of this waveguide and CSRR combination technique to the design of miniaturized waveguide bandpass filters characterized by transmission zeros is then illustrated. Filter design methodology is examined. These proposed filters exhibit high selectivity and compact size due to the employment of the subwavelength resonators and an evanescent-wave transmission. By slightly altering the configuration of the CSRRs, we find that the propagation of the TE10 mode can be suppressed and filters with improved selectivity and stopband rejection can be obtained. To verify the presented concept, three different types of filters are fabricated based on the standard printed circuit board process. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulation.},

Sequential coupling between adjacent resonators and cross coupling between nonadjacent resonators are effectively controlled by introducing small metal plates at different locations.

To exploit the increased flexibility of this new synthesis method over the traditional lossy design techniques, we then introduce a new approach to the design of lossy filters based on the characteristic polynomials evaluation. This new technique can offer many advantages over traditional techniques, and the main one is that, once the transmission function of the filter is known using traditional methods, the reflection function can be constrained with a certain degree of freedom. A tradeoff between additional constraints and redundancy in the final network must be accepted.

The design consists in a procedure for the evaluation of the characteristic polynomials of the three composing filters (defined in a normalized frequency domain), once the input junction topology and the transmission zeros of the filters have been assigned. The network synthesized from the characteristic polynomials presents the same reflection zeros of the three filters synthesized separated from the triplexer with an equiripple response in their respective passband; in this way the overall synthesized triplexer presents a quasi-equiripple response in the three passbands.

The filter has a composite structure consisting of a barium strontium titanate (BST) layer sandwiched between top and bottom platinum (Pt) electrodes deposited on silicon (Si) and oxide (SiO2) layers. The electrostrictive property of ferroelectric BST allows for the filter to be turned on and off by applying an electric field across the BST layer. The Si and SiO2 layers are used to increase the overall quality factor and mechanical strength of the structure. When the filter is turned on, the 3 dB bandwidth is 43 MHz at a center frequency of 1.08 GHz. After resonating out the input and output static capacitances of the filter using shunt inductors, the filter exhibits an insertion loss of 8.5 dB with the application of 25 V DC bias. The return loss and out-of-band rejection of the filter are 18 dB and 29 dB, respectively. In its off state, with no DC bias applied, the isolation between input and output ports is 37 dB.},

 abstract = {A new class of dielectric resonator filters with in-line structure and pseudoelliptic response is presented in this paper. The basic idea consists of using TE01δ single-mode resonators cascaded along an evanescent mode waveguide and oriented along orthogonal directions. By exploiting multiple evanescent modes, which can alternatively excite or bypass a resonator depending on its orientation, cross-coupling between nonadjacent dielectric pucks can be established and controlled. Various configurations, such as triplets, quadruplets, and quintuplets, can be obtained by properly orienting the various pucks and by exploiting a prescribed set of evanescent modes. In contrast with conventional techniques, pseudoelliptic filters can be implemented without using cumbersome cross-coupled architectures or reduced spurious performance multimode resonators. The experimental results of two sixth-order filters with two arbitrarily located transmission zeros, and a fifth-order filter with three transmission zeros validate the proposed filter class.},

Moreover, a large-signal model that accurately describes the dc-bias voltage, as well as RF power-dependent performance of BST FBARs is developed.

A circuit model and closed-form expressions are developed. Fluidic dispersions composed of low dielectric oil and high dielectric particles are utilized in a prototype resonator to provide proof-of-concept demonstrations for three applications, which are: 1) a tunable resonator; 2) a material measurement device; and 3) a fluid sensor. Theoretical values for the dielectric constant and loss tangent of the fluidic dispersion show a possible tuning range of ~ 20% across X-band. However, measurements show the materials composing the fluidic dispersion have more losses than expected and hinder performance for practical filtering applications (Q drops to 10 s). It is noted that utilizing better materials for the fluidic dispersions will greatly increase the performance as a tunable resonator. In the next application, the measurements on the prototype resonator and parametric studies from simulation are used to estimate new properties for the fluidic dispersions constituents. The final application utilizes the prototype as a fluidic sensor for measuring the volume fraction of a particulate in a fluid medium.},

 abstract = {A new class of inline pseudoelliptic waveguide filters is presented in this paper. The proposed structure is based on a novel resonator, namely, the dual-post resonator, consisting of a pair of antipodal partial-height posts. The odd and even symmetry modes of the dual-post resonator are exploited as the resonant mode and nonresonating mode, respectively. The nonresonating mode generates a direct input-to-output coupling, thus providing a transmission zero that can be located either below or above the pole of the resonant mode. The coupling between the resonant mode and the source (or load), as well as the input-to-output coupling, can be controlled by properly selecting the height and position of each post of the dual-post resonator, no additional waveguide discontinuity being needed. N th-order filtering functions with a number of transmission zeros up to the number of poles can be realized by cascading N dual-post resonators. With respect to the conventional inline waveguide filter with inductive obstacles, the dual-post filter is easier to tune, shorter, and more selective, such advantages being paid by a somewhat lower Q factor. The design of fourth- and sixth-order dual-post filters is presented; the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach proposed.},

 abstract = {A new technique to generate transmission zeros in wideband high frequency evanescent mode filters is presented in this paper. The proposed technique is based on the inverted strongly coupled resonator pair (ISCRP), which is used to provide both a resonant node and a by-pass coupling. Large sequential coupling coefficients are obtained by inverting one or both resonators of the pair. Moreover, in order to realize a sufficiently strong intra-coupling, the two resonators are embedded within a section of dielectric-loaded waveguide or alternatively connected one to each other. The ISCRP allows for the realization of a sharp transmission zero that can be located extremely close to the passband edges of a wideband filter. The experimental results of a Ku-band filter with passband ranging from 11.60 to 19.40 GHz and having a transmission zero located 120 MHz away from the lower edge of the passband validate the proposed technique.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the dimensional synthesis of coupled-resonator pseudoelliptic microwave filters with constant and dispersive couplings. The proposed technique is based on numerical simulations of small structures, involving up to two adjacent resonators, and it accounts for a loading effect from other resonators by replacing them with terminations coupled through appropriately scaled inverters. The dimensions of the resonators and coupling elements are determined by an optimization process that matches the zeros and poles of the simulated response of a low-order circuit consisting of one or two coupled resonators connected to a source and to matched loads with the eigenvalues of a submatrix obtained from the coupling matrix of the lumped-element model of the filter. To assure high accuracy and rapid convergence, a zero-pole optimization algorithm was used. The application of this method is illustrated with four examples involving a simple fourth-order open-loop microstrip filter with two transmission zeros, through a triplet with one transmission zero, a quadruplet with two asymmetric transmission zeros located on both sides of the passband, to a fourth-order waveguide filter with three transmission zeros. The validity of the method is confirmed by an experiment involving a filter with dispersive coupling realized in substrate-integrated waveguide technology.},

 abstract = {The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is becoming more crowded, and it is densely populated with various wireless signals and parasitic interferers in connection with communication and sensing services. Increasingly sophisticated radio-frequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter-wave filters are required to enable the selection and/or rejection of specific frequency channels. This will occur in future generations of the wireless system, such as the current hotly debated fifth-generation communication systems, where the spectral channelization of a heterostructured wide-band signals will be critical in support of a host of coexisting bandwidths or speeds and applications. Bandpass filters have been the most useful and popular types for such applications and are the most difficult to design and develop in practice. Other types of filters such as notch (stopband) and lowpass filters have also been widely used in many systems, and their design is generally perceived less critical with respect to band-pass filters. This article will focus on the presentation and discussion of bandpass filters. Design factors or parameters of filters, such as selectivity, cost, miniaturization, sensitivity to environmental effects (temperature and humidity, for example), and power handling, combined with predefined in-band and out-of-band performance metrics, are critical specifications of the design with respect to the development of RF and microwave front ends. This is indispensable for the efficient utilization of frequency spectrum resources and the cost-effective enhancement of wireless system performances.},

Such notch filter responses can be achieved if the topology synthesized includes arbitrary frequency variant impedances and line lengths in the main series line of filters, otherwise similar to those in [1], as was shown in [2]. The networks of [2] exhibit lowpass characteristics above the notched passband. In this paper, we substitute high pass sections for some of the lowpass series inverter sections of [2], thereby achieving selectivity both above and below the notched passband. This removes the frequent requirement to “window” the notched passband (add a bandpass filter) for harmonic and subharmonic suppression. The resulting filters exhibit lower loss than earlier “windowed” notch assemblies, provide selectivity above and below the system passband, without sacrificing notch characteristics required within the system passband.},

The basic idea consists of using high-Q bypassed TE201 mode cavities embedded within two or more evanescent mode resonators. Such a combination of resonators allows the generation of extremely close transmission zeros while realizing at the same time relatively wide passbands and stopbands, the latter being a typical feature of the evanescent mode filter class. In contrast with other pseudoelliptic evanescent mode filters using conventional approaches, the insertion loss degradation at the filter cut-off frequencies is minimized thanks to the high-Q factor of the bypassed TE201 mode cavities, whose corresponding poles are located right at the edges of the passband. The experimental results of a waveguide evanescent mode filter having 9.950-11.000 GHz passband and providing more than 45 dB rejection between 11.040 and 11.050 GHz validate the proposed solution.},

Therefore, this paper describes the design, manufacturing, and testing of a new class of textile microwave components for wearable applications, implemented in SIW technology. After characterizing the adopted textile fabrics material in terms of electrical properties, it is shown that folded textile SIW components, such as interconnections, filters, and antennas form excellent building blocks for wearable microwave circuits, given their low profile, flexibility, and stable characteristics under bending and in proximity of the human body. Hence, they allow the full exploitation of the large area garments offered for the deployment of wearable electronics. Besides SIW interconnections, a folded textile SIW filter operating at 2.45 GHz is designed and tested. The filter combines excellent performance in the band of interest with good out-of-band rejection, even when accounting for the tolerances in the fabrication process.

 abstract = {In this paper a new class of in-line filters with pseudoelliptic responses exploiting the TE01δ dielectric mode is presented. The basic structure consists of a single resonant dielectric puck placed into a rectangular propagating waveguide. Couplings are controlled by a proper positioning of the puck, and no irises are required. The fundamental propagating mode of the waveguide is exploited to bypass the resonator so as to obtain couplings between non adjacent resonators, allowing responses with a number of zeros equal to the number of poles. Direct input-to-output coupling is incorporated, resulting in very selective responses. With respect to classical waveguide filters, the maximum number of transmission zeros is obtained in a more compact waveguide section while not sacrificing the quality factor. Furthermore, in contrast with conventional dielectric resonator filters, which are limited to very narrow band applications, filters having a FBW up to 2% (or more) can be designed with the proposed approach. Higher order filters are obtained by cascading singlets, resulting in designs with high modularity. The connection between singlets is accurately taken into account in the equivalent circuit and no further optimization is required after the cascade, also allowing an exact positioning of the transmission zeros. Design of three pole filters demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach, while the measurement of a manufactured filter with a FBW of 2,3% demonstrate its feasibility.},

We propose a modification to the standard five element BVD model, in which a second resistor is added in series with the plate capacitance C/sub 0/. This improves the model predictions as compared to the data obtained from a network analyzer (NWA). Here, the modified model will be developed in terms of the resonant frequencies, effective coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/, and the quality factor Q, as determined from the S parameters of an FBAR measured by the NWA. To evaluate the FBAR resonators on a routine basis, an automated data acquisition and parameter extraction method based on the Modified Butterworth-Van Dyke model (MBVD) is described. An Agilent Technologies 8753ES NWA operating under Personal Computer control is used to acquire and process FBAR data by means of a custom HPVEE/sup TM/ program, which transfers data from the NWA, and extracts the six MBVD circuit parameters. Excellent agreement is obtained between the measured data for a typical FBAR resonator and calculated "postdictions" obtained from the MBVD circuit. Coupled with the automated method, which takes about 10 seconds per resonator to perform a complete extraction cycle, a computer controlled probing station is used to acquire data from several hundred resonators on the wafer upon which the FBARS were fabricated. With this speed and probing capability, it is feasible to wafer map the FBARs for uniformity. Contour plots of the measured resonant frequency and coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/ will be presented to illustrate the capability.},

@article{Adhikari_2013,
 abstract = {A concept of simultaneous electric (E) and magnetic ( H) 2-D tuning is presented, demonstrated, and applied for the first time through the theoretical and experimental studies of parameter-agile substrated integrated waveguide (SIW) devices. First of all, a two-dimensionally tuned SIW cavity is introduced as a building block. Considering only electric tuning with varactor diodes, no more than 1.3% of total tuning range is accomplished, while for simultaneous electric and magnetic tuning, it is extended to 7.9% with an unloaded Q factor of better than 130. Using 0.05-0.1-pF surface mount capacitors, a total tuning range of as much as 20% is experimentally achieved at 12 GHz. Another characteristic of significant interest is that the proposed 2-D tuning not only allows changing frequency, but also simultaneously optimizing other key parameters such as the return loss or unloaded Q factor. Second, the dual-tuned SIW cavity resonator is further accommodated to demonstrate parameter agile two-dimensionally tuned bandpass filter at 12 GHz. The proposed concept of 2-D tuning theoretically and experimentally demonstrates a simultaneous frequency and bandwidth tuning of bandpass filter. This filter can perform both frequency-tunable constant bandwidth, and constant-frequency variable-bandwidth operations. Third, a cavity backed slot antenna using the proposed dual tuning is demonstrated. The tuning not only achieves a higher frequency range, but the antenna return loss is optimized to improve the overall efficiency.},

The basic idea consists of embedding non-resonating mode waveguide cavities within the structure of an evanescent-mode filter. Such a combination of cavities and resonators allows the generation of very close transmission zeros while realizing at the same time relatively wide passbands and stopbands. Both H-plane TE201 mode and E-plane TM110 mode configurations are used as non-resonating mode waveguide cavities. In contrast with the other elliptic evanescent-mode filters using conventional approaches, the insertion loss degradation at the filter cut-off frequencies is minimized thanks to the high-Q factor of the waveguide cavities, whose corresponding poles are located right at the edges of the passband. The experimental results of an evanescent-mode filter having 9.950-11.000 GHz passband and providing more than 45 dB rejection between 11.040 and 11.050 GHz validate the proposed solution.},

 abstract = {Electrically tunable solidly mounted thin film bulk acoustic resonators based on Ba0.25Sr0.75TiO3 and BaTiO3 films are fabricated and measured in wide dc bias voltage and temperature ranges. At room temperature, the tunability of the series and parallel resonances for the Ba0.25Sr0.75TiO3 resonator are 1.7% and 0.3%, respectively, for 15 V bias voltage applied over the 350 nm thick ferroelectric film (43 V/μm). The electromechanical coupling coefficient increases with dc bias up to 3.7% at 15 V. The measured tunability and coupling coefficient are limited partly by the quality of the used films. Potentially, they may be substantially increased for high quality films allowing application of higher dc fields. The resonator quality factor is approximately 100. The measured resonator response is in good agreement with available models based on the electromechanical equations describing the ferroelectric film under applied dc and ac electric fields. Measurements of the resonance frequencies of the Ba0.25Sr0.75TiO3 resonator as a function of temperature in the range 40–520 K reveal a sharp step at 150 K which is related to a structural phase transition of the ferroelectric material. The series resonance frequency is tuned to lower frequencies with increasing dc bias for all temperatures, while the parallel resonance frequency reveals a change in the sign of the tunability at approximately 150 K, from being tuned to lower frequencies at high temperatures to being tuned to higher frequencies at low temperatures. Measurements of BaTiO3 resonators in the temperature range 300–520 K are presented and compared to the Ba0.25Sr0.75TiO3 results.},

With LTCC technology, there is more flexibility to organize the cavities of filters because of the 3-D arrangement. The vertically stacked cavities are coupled by ldquoLrdquo- or ldquoUrdquo-shaped slots, and if arranged horizontally, by an inductive window on the common sidewall or a suspended stripline between the cavities. Through experimental measurements and simulations at both the Ka - V -bands, it has been demonstrated that the proposed filter has compact sizes and good frequency responses. The area of the fully stacked Chebyshev filter has 88% size reduction in comparison with a three-pole planar waveguide filter, while the vertically stacked quasi-elliptic filter has 74% size reduction in comparison with a four-pole planar waveguide filter.},

This work also presents the combined response (cascaded S parameters) of a resonator and a switch that were co-fabricated on the same substrate. The response shows that the resonator can be effectively turned on and off by the switch. A post-CMOS compatible process was used for the co-fabrication of both the switches and the resonators.

TM dual-mode cavities loaded with high-permittivity (εr > 30) ceramic cylinders are employed, while non-resonating modes are used to create N transmission zeros symmetrically or non-symmetrically located in the pass-band. A single cavity behaves as a generalized doublet generating two transmission poles and two transmission zeros and is used as a basic building block for N-pole and N-zero filters with symmetric or asymmetric response. To prove the effectiveness of the approach, a very compact fourth-order filter with 4.35 GHz center frequency, four transmission zeros has been designed, fabricated, and tested showing an unloaded Q close to 2000. It is finally shown that the filter response can be shifted in frequency by simply replacing the dielectric material with another having different εr, so that the same metal enclosure can be used to realize various filters operating at different frequency bands.},

the ultimate stopband depth is sacrificed in favor of a faster
transition from the passband to a specified minimum equiripple stopband
attenuation level (i.e., steeper attenuation slope) with no increase in
filter order (as compared to a Chebyshev or similar transfer function
design). Such notch-filter responses can be achieved if the topology
synthesized includes arbitrary frequency invariant impedances and line
lengths in the main series line of filters. Using lumped approximations
to the series coaxial sections but with the series sections not at 50
Ω (for a 50-Ω filter), it is possible to improve upon the
Chebyshev-based results. The resulting network provides lower passband
insertion loss, with no reduction in minimum notch depth or power
handling, improved temperature performance and additional harmonic
reduction. The improvements are due to the implementation of the
quasi-elliptic response defined above, and are made possible by the
larger range of main line impedances and line lengths available using
inductors and capacitors rather than lengths of transmission line. In
principle, the technique can be extended to achieve full-elliptic

 abstract = {This paper attempts to provide a panoramic picture of the research and development of substrate integrated circuits (SICs), presumably the next generation of high-frequency integrated circuits for GHz and THz electronics and photonics. This work begins with a summarized overview of current status of SICs-related research over microwave and millimeter-wave frequency ranges, and an outlook into their future development is then discussed with respect to the last unexplored (or rather limited) explored frontier of THz electromagnetic spectrum. With special interest in low-cost and matured CMOS and Si-related technologies, we would be able to examine the possibility of using SICs technologies within such matured processing platforms. This development may be enabled by the rapid deployment of through-silicon via (TSV) processes and related 3-D stack Silicon techniques as well as material research progress such as nanostructured and subwavelength plasmonics. In this way, SICs may allow us to anticipate and extrapolate their applications trends towards the THz frequency range where no tangible integrated circuits technology is available to date. Challenging issues and future directions are considered, pointing to a potentially cost-effective and performance-promising ICs solution for mass commercial applications.},

@article{1381754,
 abstract = {Block-banded matrices generalize banded matrices. We study the properties of positive definite full matrices P whose inverses A are L-block-banded. We show that, for such matrices, the blocks in the L-block band of P completely determine P; namely, all blocks of P outside its L-block band are computed from the blocks in the L-block band of P. We derive fast inversion algorithms for P and its inverse A that, when compared to direct inversion, are faster by two orders of magnitude of the linear dimension of the constituent blocks. We apply these inversion algorithms to successfully develop fast approximations to Kalman-Bucy filters in applications with high dimensional states where the direct inversion of the covariance matrix is computationally unfeasible.},

@article{6072546,
 abstract = {To reduce the computational complexity of matrix inversion, which is the majority of processing in many practical applications, two numerically efficient recursive algorithms (called algorithms I and II, respectively) are presented. Algorithm I is used to calculate the inverse of such a matrix, whose leading principal minors are all nonzero. Algorithm II, whereby, the inverse of an arbitrary nonsingular matrix can be evaluated is derived via improving the algorithm I. The implementation, for algorithm II or I, involves matrix-vector multiplications and vector outer products. These operations are computationally fast and highly parallelizable. MATLAB simulations show that both recursive algorithms are valid.},
