1. Training.csv : contains the training set and relevant papers marked as 1 and irrelevant ones as 0

2. Testing-test.csv: contains the Forward round 1 results using 41 papers in the seed set. It is the 
   real testing set in the ML experiment. Out of 35 relevant papers in Testing.csv, 33 papers have been
   identified in Forward round 1 results, and marked manually as 1 in this csv file. (Manually because
   there are many unicode characters that couldn't be translated from the web scraping like '-' which
   is present here as '{\textdash}' because of which we can't perform direct matching of the titles in
   Testing.csv. Hence the relevant ones found by the tool need to be manually annotated here for the ML 
   experiment.)

3. Testing.csv: contains only the relevant papers against which the results will be validated
