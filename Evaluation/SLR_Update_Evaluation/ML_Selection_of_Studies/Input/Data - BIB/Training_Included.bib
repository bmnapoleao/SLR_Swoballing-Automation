	abstract     = {Background: Action research is a well-established research methodology. It is following a post-positivist research philosophy grounded in critical thinking. The methodology is driven by practical problems, emphasis participatory research, and develops practically useful solutions in an iterative manner.Objective: Two objectives are to be achieved: (1) Understanding the state of the art with respect to action research usage in the software engineering literature, and (2) reflecting and providing recommendations of how to foster industry-academia collaboration through action research. Method: Based on our experience with two action research studies in close collaboration with Ericsson lessons learned and guidelines are presented.Results: In both cases presented action research led to multiple refinements in the interventions implemented. Furthermore, the close collaboration and co-production with the industry was essential to identify and describe the required refinements to provide an in-depth understanding. In comparison with previous studies, we required multiple iterations while previous software engineering studies reported mostly one iteration, or were not explicit regarding the number of iterations studied.Conclusion: We conclude that action research is a powerful tool for industry-academia collaboration. The success of the method highly depends on the researchers and practitioners working in a team. Future studies need to improve the reporting with respect to describing the type of action research used, the iterations, the model of collaboration, and the rationales for changes in each iteration.},

While researchers have spent years on post-university studies to learn the profession of data collection, data analysis, and data sensemaking, developers are trained to produce and deliver in time based on current best thinking. Taking different paths after the university studies soon ends up in different governing variables for developers and researchers of what brings value. This is a well-known phenomenon, and numerous articles and books are describing why this is the case (Barnes et al., Eur Manag J 20(3):272-285, 2002; Mathiassen, Inf Technol People 14(4):321-345, 2002; Mora-Valentin et al., Res Policy 33(1):17-40, 2004; Gorschek et al., IEEE Softw 23(6):88-95, 2006; Rombach and Achatz, Research collaboration between academia and industry.

In the Software Center we have found practical ways on how to make developers and researchers appreciate the same values and by that join forces to solve complex software engineering issues. A key instrument is to get close on all levels from steering groups to reference groups and research teams. In the following chapter, we describe how we in the Software Center work in practice to stimulate a close collaboration and what is required to make this work over time.}

We consider innovation as a process consisting of two phases, being technology creation and technology transfer. In this paper, we focus mainly on the transfer phase. Technology transfer is of mutual interest to both academia and industry. Transfer is important for academia, because it shows the industrial relevance of their research results to, for example, their sponsoring authorities. Showing the industrial applicability of research results is sometimes referred to as valorization of research. Nowadays, valorization is often required by research funding bodies. The transfer is important for industries, because innovating their development processes and their products is supportive in gaining a competitive edge or remaining competitive in their business. We describe the technology transfer phase by means of three activities: technology evaluation, technology engineering, and technology embedding. The technology evaluation activity is perceived as the main gate between the technology creation phase and the technology transfer phase. With two case studies, originating from the Dutch high-tech systems industry, we will illustrate the activities in the transfer phase. In addition to the process we will also define the main roles in a software engineering technology innovation, namely: the technology provider (academic research, industrial research and technology vendor) and the technology receiver (industrial development). With those roles we also address the issues concerning the ownership of technologies.}

Empirical studies in general and empirical studies in industrial settings in particular have played an important role in successful transition of many Software Engineering technologies to industry, for example, defect detection techniques and automated test cases. However, conducting empirical research in industrial settings remains a challenging undertaking for a variety of reasons. There is no substantial literature reporting on the challenges and complexities involved in conducting empirical studies in an industry in general and in settings whose business models are built around global sourcing. This paper reports some of our experiences and lessons learned from conducting empirical research in industry. Some of the observed challenges include short time horizon for research, high expectations, limited research skills, and the ?acceptable? research rigor. The paper discusses some of these issues with relevant examples and provides some strategies for overcoming these issues. We also stress that researchers and practitioners should share their experiences of conducting empirical research in order to help build a body of knowledge to guide the future efforts.},

This paper examines key enabling factors for an efficient and effective industry-academia collaboration in the software testing domain. A major finding of the research was that while technology is a strong enabler to better collaboration, it must be complemented with industrial openness to disclose research results and the use of a dedicated tooling platform.

The taxonomy architecture provides a basis for classifying research from a problem perspective which in turn supports the breaking down of complex practical challenges to researchable units. Thus such taxonomy may support the mapping of challenges in industry to research solutions in the software engineering context.Method: In this paper we present SERP and exemplifies its usage based on two literature studies in the field of software engineering. Further, we discuss how a taxonomy based on this architecture could have helped us in two past research projects that were conducted in close collaboration with industry. Finally we validate SERP by applying it to the area of software testing, developing SERP-test, and interviewing two industry practitioners and two researchers.Results: The taxonomy architecture has been applied to two problems in software testing, and has been assessed through interviews with practitioners and researchers. The interviews provided suggestions of how to improve the taxonomy architecture, which have been incorporated. With two examples, we demonstrated how the taxonomy architecture could be used to find solutions for industrial problems, and to find the problems addressed by a particular solution.Conclusion: SERP may be useful in multiple ways: (1) Given that SERP taxonomies are populated with industrial problems and scientific solutions, we could rapidly identify candidate research solutions for industrial practice. (2) Researchers could benefit from the taxonomy in the reporting of their research to ease the mapping to industrial challenges.},

If not adressed upfront, they may hinder collaboration in such projects. We analyze our experiences from a 10 year industry--academia collaboration program, the EASE Industrial Excellence Center in Sweden, and identify issues and feasible practices to overcome the hurdles of different time horizons. Specifically, we identify issues related to contracts, goals, results, organization (in)stability, and work practices. We identify several areas where the time horizon is different, and conclude that mutual awareness of these differences and management commitment to the collaboration are the key means to overcome the differences. The launch of a mediating institute may also be part of the solution.},

The Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in Kaiserslautern, Germany, focuses on software engineering methods, software product and process management, and learning organization concepts for software. It applies an experiment- or feedback-based transfer model, which has led to many successful and sustained improvements in the industrial practice of software development. In this paper, the underlying transfer model, key business areas and core competencies of Fraunhofer IESE, as well as examples of industrial transfer projects are illustrated. The presentation concludes with arguments as to why this transfer approach is well-suited for software development and why it is a prerequisite for the professionalization of software development.},

We evaluated our collaboration with an existing model for technology transfer, and performed a focus group discussion to identify challenges we have faced. After initialization and alignment of the collaboration, a high maturity level has been achieved: we have obtained the first results in form of proposed solutions, scientific publications, and pilots run in real projects. In spite of this positive progress, further initiatives need to be undertaken in the last phases of the collaboration to achieve high degrees of maturity in deployment impact, industry benefit and innovativeness. Evaluating the collaboration has been positive, since we identified the next steps to be taken to achieve a high degree of technology transfer and innovation dissemination.

The presentation is divided into experiences at the graduate and postgraduate levels, respectively. For each level a number of strategies to achieve industrial relevance are presented. On the graduate level a course in large-scale software development is described to exemplify how industrial relevance can be achieved on the graduate level. The strategies on the postgraduate level have been successful, but it is concluded that more can be done regarding industrial collaboration in the planning and conduction of experiments and case studies. Another interesting strategy for the future is a special postgraduate program for people employed in industry.}

	abstract     = {Collaboration between industry practitioners and researchers has been reported as a challenge to conduct empirical studies in software engineering. Gaining practitioners interest in research activities is challenging in the software development industry characterized by tough competition and short time-to-market. Often, practitioners do not see the direct value in collaborating with researchers. Meanwhile, researchers are frequently frustrated because they have no access to the real-world data that would enable them to develop scientific knowledge. Design science has become a popular research framework in Information Systems. This paper describes our lessons learned on how design science can help to attract and motivate industry practitioners to take part in empirical research. We present our practical experiences with using design science in the context of empirical software engineering, and how the design science framework helped us to bridge the collaborative gap with our industry partners. In illustrating our experiences, we present two case studies conducted in collaboration with Ericsson and Elektrobit in which the design science framework was followed. Based on our experience, design science is a suitable research framework for empirical software engineering since much of the research in the field is constructive. The similarities between the design science practices and the day-to-day work of practitioners in industry make it easy for them to understand the research approach. Thus, it supports their willingness to participate in research activities.},

The rationale of AR is to foster the transition of knowledge from a mature research field to practical problems encountered in the daily routine.

This paper outlines our expe- rience with three research projects conducted in collaboration with the industry. We examine the way we collaborated with our industry part- ners and describe the decisions that contributed to the effectiveness of the collaborations. We report on the lessons learned from our experience and illustrate the lessons using examples from the three projects. The lessons focus on the applications of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), as all the three projects we draw on here were MDE projects. Our goal from structuring and sharing our experience is to contribute to a better understanding of how researchers and practitioners can collaborate more effectively and to gain more value from their collaborations.}

Objective: Our goal was to gain more and current knowledge about how technology transfer from software engineering (SE) research into industrial practice is accomplished best and how to measure the effectiveness of this transfer. Method: We conducted a study in the context of two German research projects, covering many different organizations from industry and academia. Results: This paper presents the design of the study and the survey performed. After introducing the concept of technology transfer we used and adapted, we present preliminary results. Conclusions: We observed that traditional means such as meetings or workshops are still the most widely used mediums for technology transfer in SE. We also discovered that, even though the duration of transfer depends on the object being transferred, the average duration is three years, which is far less than previously published (~18 years).},

A rich body of knowledge exists on the development of languages, modeling environments, and transformation systems. The understanding of architectural choices for combining these parts into a feasible solution, however, is not particularly deep. We report on an endeavor in the realm of a technology transfer process from academia to industry, where we encountered unexpected influences of the architecture on the modeling language. By examining the evolution of our language and its programming interface, we show that these influences mainly stemmed from practical considerations; for identifying these early on, tight interaction between our research lab and the industrial partner was key. In addition, we share insights into the practice of cooperating with industry by presenting essential lessons we learned.},

Conventional model of technology transfer implies a unidirectional transfer from technology providers to technology requesters. However, this is not a case in successful technology transfer. In our experience, we observed a reciprocal feedback relationship between the providers and requesters. As the model of such collaboration, we propose a co-evolutionary model of technology transfer, which enables to adjust the level of maturity of technology to be transferred and accelerate the transfer process.},

The chapter is illustrated using as a case study a research collaboration in which the authors are involved. We enumerate the costs, benefits, risks and risk-reducing factors that can have an impact on all the parties involved in the collaboration (the company, the faculty members and the graduate student researchers). Understanding this information is needed to help justify the research in the first place, and to manage it effectively. We then discuss many of the activities that will be needed to plan and manage the project, including such issues as attracting students, handling intellectual property, obtaining ethical approval and interacting with participants. The main objective of the chapter is to provoke some thoughts in the minds of those planning empirical research projects in software engineering.}

The relevance of an investigation for a given environment, however, depends on the similarities or dissimilarities of the investigation environment compared to the industrial environment which is interested in using a new technology. The optimal (or most relevant) results may be gained when performing the experiment in the industrial environment itself. Unfortunately, this takes place only rarely as experiments in industrial environments are either expensive (when new and old technology are used in parallel) or risky (when only the new technology is used). To overcome this dilemma, we introduced the concept of external experiments, i.e. experiments which are conducted in an environment different from the industrial target environment and which tries to simulate the characteristics of the industrial environment as best as possible. This paper describes this concept in detail, presents a process for identification, conduction and exploitation of such experiments and shows some results from past investigations which used this concept},
