Structuring automotive product lines and feature models: an exploratory study at Opel,"Automotive systems are highly complex and customized systems containing a vast amount of variability. Feature modeling plays a key role in customization. Empirical evidence through industry application, and in particular methodological guidance of how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models is needed. The overall aim of this work is to provide guidance to practitioners how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models, understanding strengths and weaknesses of alternative structures. The research was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the context situation was understood using interviews and workshops. In the second phase, possible structures of product lines and feature models were evaluated based on industry feedback collected in workshops. In the third phase, the structures were implemented in the tool GEARS and practitioner feedback was collected. One key challenge was the unavailability of structuring guidelines, which was the focus of this research. The structures considered most suitable for the automotive product line were multiple product lines with modular decomposition. The structures most suitable for the feature model were functional decomposition, using context variability, models corresponding to assets, and feature categories. Other structures have been discarded, and the rationales have been presented. It was possible to support the most suitable structures with the commercial tool GEARS. The implementation in GEARS and the feedback from the practitioners provide early indications for the potential usefulness of the structures and the tool implementation.",0
Using Scrum in Outsourced Government Projects: An Action Research,"The growth in popularity of Agile methods plus a dissatisfaction of Government agencies with traditional software development methods have stimulated the adoption of Agile Methods. The action research approach was used in this work to assess the implementation of a process for the Management of Agile Development Demands - whose original acronym in Portuguese is 'GeDDAS' - for a software factory in a Brazilian Federal Government Organisation. There, two-action research cycles were done with two pilot projects. The work of action research was effective and contributed to the successful outcome of the initiative. The implementation of agile approaches in a public organisation is slow and complex affair mainly due to the interferences made in the working environment of the companies involved and to a high staff turnover. In the end, the difficulties found and lessons learned in the process, as well as the results achieved are presented.",0
Interventions for Software Security: Creating a Lightweight Program of Assurance Techniques for Developers,"Though some software development teams are highly effective at delivering security, others either do not care or do not have access to security experts to teach them how. Unfortunately, these latter teams are still responsible for the security of the systems they build: systems that are ever more important to ever more people. We propose that a series of lightweight in-terventions, six hours of facilitated workshops delivered over three months, can improve a team's motivation to consider security and awareness of assurance techniques, changing its security culture even when no security experts are involved. The interventions were developed after an Appreciative Inquiry and Grounded Theory survey of security professionals to find out what approaches work best. They were then validated in fieldwork with a Participatory Action Research study that de-livered the workshops to three development organizations. This approach has the potential to be applied by many development teams, improving the security of software worldwide.",0
Sustainability analysis and ease of learning in artifact-based requirements engineering: The newest member of the family of studies (It?s a girl!),"Context: Artifact-based requirements engineering promises to deliver results of high quality while allowing for flexibility in the development process and the project settings. Tailored for analyzing sustainability, it can offer tangible insights on potential benefits and risks of a system under development. However, as of now there is still relatively little empirical evidence available that would prove this quality, flexibility, and insight potential. Previous studies, specifically on the first two characteristics, differ in their socio-economic contexts and make the findings hard to generalize. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the advantages and limitations in the application of artifact-based requirements engineering by new, inexperienced requirements engineers to extend our family of studies. In addition, the secondary goal is to evaluate the suitability of the sustainability analysis artifact for a sustainability analysis of the system planned for development. Method: We report on a new member in a family of studies with 20 participants for evaluating artifact models in a sustainability application context. We use a graduate block course as case. Our data collection is performed via survey at the end of the course, based on the same instrument used in previous studies, and extended with a new section on evaluating the suitability of a particular artifact for sustainability analysis. Results: Both from the quantitative and the qualitative feedback, the results indicate that the students have benefitted from the artifact-based approach to analyzing sustainability in requirements engineering. Usability, syntactic and semantic quality were all rated high and the rationales were positive, as was the feedback on the sustainability analysis artifact. Conclusion: The results contribute to a reliable database on artifact-oriented requirements engineering and strengthen our confidence in the general benefits of artifact-orientation. Relating the old and new data provides some more insight into the trajectory of the wider transfer of artifact-based requirements engineering into practice.",0
Light-Touch Interventions to Improve Software Development Security,"Many software developers still have little interest in software security. To change this, we need 'interventions' to development teams to motivate and help them towards security improvement. An intervention costing less than two days' effort from a facilitator plus half a day of team effort can significantly improve that team's software security. This case study describes how this approach was used with one commercial team, and identifies its impact using Participative Action Research. With suitable improvements, the approach has the potential to help many other development teams.",0
Academic and Industrial Software Testing Conferences: Survey and Synergies,"Just as with any other profession, an efficient way to exchange ideas and networking in software testing are conferences, workshops and similar events. This is true for both professional testers and researchers working in the testing area. However, these two groups usually look for different kinds of events: a tester likes to attend 'industrial' (sometimes called practitioner's or user) conferences, whereas a researcher is more likely interested in 'academic' (in other words scientific or research) conferences. Although there are notable exceptions, this separation is substantial, which hinders a successful academy-industry collaboration, and communication about the demand and supply of research in software testing. This paper reviews 101 conferences: two thirds are academic ones, the rest being industrial. Besides providing this reasonably comprehensive list, we analyze any visible synergies such as events that have a mixed Program Committee and offer a program with elements from both sides. We found only a handful of such events, but these can serve both as opportunities for attendees who wish to extend their perspectives and as models for organizers of future conferences.",0
Applying Data Analytics towards Optimized Issue Management: An Industrial Case Study,"This document describes our experience of applying data analytics at Plexina, a leading IT company working in the healthcare domain. The main goal of the project was to identify factors currently affecting issue management and to make analytics based suggestions for optimizing the process. Various statistical and machine learning techniques were applied on a data set extracted from six releases of Plexina, containing more than 666 issues. Statistical techniques successfully identified the various factors that leads to estimation inaccuracy related to issues as well as identified the hidden relationships existing among various variables. The employed predictive analytic models was also successful to some extent, in predicting effort estimation related inaccuracy associated with the issues. The insights provided by the entire data analytics study can be of great help to product managers or the developers to make more informed decisions. In addition, the guidelines presented in this paper based on the lessons learnt can be applied to other data analytics and academia-industry collaboration project.",0
Case Studies of Industry-Academia Research Collaborations for Software Development with Agile,"Successful industry-academia research collaborations (IARCs) in the software development area can be challenging. The literature identifies best practices in IARCs along with process frameworks with the aim of ensuring successful outcomes for both industry and academia, namely: funding opportunities for universities, training and employment possibilities for students, new knowledge leading to innovative products for industry, and on-time delivery of software benefiting the economy, the institution, and the community. This paper shows ways in which core principles of the project management approach, Agile, and the Scrum framework have been applied and have led to the success of three IARCs. In addition to IARCs' common challenges, these case studies represented additional challenges as they were short-term software development projects accomplished by small geographically distributed teams. A report of the demographic, collaboration setting, and challenges, along with the lessons learned from the application of Agile and Scrum in these case studies will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of IARCs. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, five Agile/Scrum aspects for each project are assessed: product ownership, release, sprint, team, and technical health. Findings indicate several success factors directly linked to the application of the Agile principles and the Scrum framework. Specifically, early and frequent customer-centric software delivery, constant communications, responsiveness to change, and highly motivated individuals were key in terms of realizing the positive outcomes in spite of the obstacles inherent to IARCs. Cautions to this approach when applied in IARCs are reported along with solutions.",0
Wide Band Patch Antenna Structures for Cognitive Radio Applications,"The growing demand for the wireless connectivity has insisted a new communication technique to exploit the usage of spectrum in an efficient way. Many Techniques including Cognitive Radio (CR) technology provides the capability to share the spectrum and provides the high band width to the users by using dynamic access techniques. These techniques allow unlicensed secondary users to access the licensed spectrum without any disturbance. A special antenna is required in Cognitive Radio applications for spectrum sensing and communicating. Wide Band antennas are being considered as the most suitable structures for spectrum sensing applications and are perfectly suitable these environments. In this paper, an attempt is made to present the design of simple patch antenna structures by using circular, semi-circular, Semi-circular triangle shaped, semi-circular crown shaped antennas for achieving the wide band characteristics. These structures were analyzed theoretically and the simulation was done by using CST Microwave Studio Suite. All the structures were fabricated and analyzed in between 1-18 GHz frequency range on RT-Duroid substrate. It is found that these Structures achieve an enhanced impedance bandwidth over the frequency ranges other than Ultra Wide Band (UWB) range and up to Ku Band.",0
Interventions for long-term software security: Creating a lightweight program of assurance techniques for developers,"Summary Though some software development teams are highly effective at delivering security, others either do not care or do not have access to security experts to teach them how. Unfortunately, these latter teams are still responsible for the security of the systems they build: systems that are ever more important to ever more people. We propose that a series of lightweight interventions, six hours of facilitated workshops delivered over three months, can improve a team's motivation to consider security and awareness of assurance techniques, changing its security culture even when no security experts are involved. The interventions were developed after an Appreciative Inquiry and Grounded Theory survey of security professionals to find out what approaches work best. We tested the interventions in a participatory action research field study where we delivered the workshops to three software development organizations and evaluated their effectiveness through interviews beforehand, immediately afterwards, and after twelve months. We found that the interventions can be effective with teams with limited or no security experience and that improvement is long-lasting. This approach and the learning points arising from the work here have the potential to be applied in many development teams, improving the security of software worldwide.",0
Measuring and Improving Agile Processes in a Small-Size Software Development Company,"Context: Agile software development has become commonplace in software development companies due to the numerous benefits it provides. However, conducting Agile projects is demanding in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), because projects start and end quickly, but still have to fulfil customers' quality requirements. Objective: This paper aims at reporting a practical experience on the use of metrics related to the software development process as a means supporting SMEs in the development of software following an Agile methodology. Method: We followed Action-Research principles in a Polish small-size software development company. We developed and executed a study protocol suited to the needs of the company, using a pilot case. Results: A catalogue of Agile development process metrics practically validated in the context of a small-size software development company, adopted by the company in their Agile projects. Conclusions: Practitioners may adopt these metrics in their Agile projects, especially if working in an SME, and customise them to their own needs and tools. Academics may use the findings as a baseline for new research work, including new empirical studies.",0
An Action Research for Improving the Sustainability Assessment Framework Instruments,"In the last years, software engineering researchers have defined sustainability as a quality requirement of software, but not enough effort has been devoted to develop new methods/techniques to support the analysis and assessment of software sustainability. In this study, we present the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) that consists of two instruments: the software sustainability&ndash;quality model, and the architectural decision map. Then, we use participatory and technical action research in close collaboration with the software industry to validate the SAF regarding its applicability in specific cases. The unit of analysis of our study is a family of software products (Geographic Information System- and Mobile-based Workforce Management Systems) that aim to address sustainability goals (e.g., efficient collection of dead animals to mitigate social and environmental sustainability risks). The results show that the sustainability&ndash;quality model integrated with the architectural decision maps can be used to identify sustainability&ndash;quality requirements as design concerns because most of its quality attributes (QAs) have been either addressed in the software project or acknowledged as relevant (i.e., creating awareness on the relevance of the multidimensional sustainability nature of certain QAs). Moreover, the action&ndash;research method has been helpful to enrich the sustainability&ndash;quality model, by identifying missing QAs (e.g., regulation compliance, data privacy). Finally, the architectural decision maps have been found as useful to guide software architects/designers in their decision-making process.",0
Using Participatory Technical-action-research to validate a Software Sustainability Model,"[Context and Motivation] In the last years,software engineering researchers have contributed to defining the notion of sustainability-aware software as a quality requirement. [Question/problem] The field is,however, still missing instruments supporting the design and assessment of software sustainability.[Objective] This research aims at providing a validated Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) through along-term empirical study in close-collaboration with the software industry. [Methodology] By using the participatory technical action-research method, we validate the sustainability-quality model, one of the instruments of the SAF framework, by means of investigating its applicability in an industrial software project and detecting potential improvements.[Results] Our results confirm the effective applicability of our model as most of its quality attributes (QAs) have been either addressed in the software project or acknowledged as relevant. The action-research method was also very useful for enriching our model by identifying QAs missing in the model (e.g. regulation compliance, data privacy).[Contribution] The sustainability-quality model can be effectively used as an instrument for identifying sustainability-quality requirements, and creating awareness on the relevance of the multidimensional sustainability nature of certain quality attributes.",0
Towards Automated Detection of Data Pipeline Faults,"Data pipelines play an important role throughout the data management process. It automates the steps ranging from data generation to data reception thereby reducing the human intervention. A failure or fault in a single step of a data pipeline has cascading effects that might result in hours of manual intervention and clean-up. Data pipeline failure due to faults at different stages of data pipelines is a common challenge that eventually leads to significant performance degradation of data-intensive systems. To ensure early detection of these faults and to increase the quality of the data products, continuous monitoring and fault detection mechanism should be included in the data pipeline. In this study, we have explored the need for incorporating automated fault detection mechanisms and mitigation strategies at different stages of the data pipeline. Further, we identified faults at different stages of the data pipeline and possible mitigation strategies that can be adopted for reducing the impact of data pipeline faults thereby improving the quality of data products. The idea of incorporating fault detection and mitigation strategies is validated by realizing a small part of the data pipeline using action research in the analytics team at a large software-intensive organization within the telecommunication domain.",0
Guiding the selection of research methodology in industry?academia collaboration in software engineering,"Background: The literature concerning research methodologies and methods has increased in software engineering in the last decade. However, there is limited guidance on selecting an appropriate research methodology for a given research study or project. Objective: Based on a selection of research methodologies suitable for software engineering research in collaboration between industry and academia, we present, discuss and compare the methodologies aiming to provide guidance on which research methodology to choose in a given situation to ensure successful industry?academia collaboration in research. Method: Three research methodologies were chosen for two main reasons. Design Science and Action Research were selected for their usage in software engineering. We also chose a model emanating from software engineering, i.e., the Technology Transfer Model. An overview of each methodology is provided. It is followed by a discussion and an illustration concerning their use in industry?academia collaborative research. The three methodologies are then compared using a set of criteria as a basis for our guidance. Results: The discussion and comparison of the three research methodologies revealed general similarities and distinct differences. All three research methodologies are easily mapped to the general research process describe?solve?practice, while the main driver behind the formulation of the research methodologies is different. Thus, we guide in selecting a research methodology given the primary research objective for a given research study or project in collaboration between industry and academia. Conclusions: We observe that the three research methodologies have different main objectives and differ in some characteristics, although still having a lot in common. We conclude that it is vital to make an informed decision concerning which research methodology to use. The presentation and comparison aim to guide selecting an appropriate research methodology when conducting research in collaboration between industry and academia.",0
Model-based testing in practice: An experience report from the web applications domain,"In the context of a software testing company, we have deployed the model-based testing (MBT) approach to take the company?s test automation practices to higher levels of maturity and capability. We have chosen, from a set of open-source/commercial MBT tools, an open-source tool named GraphWalker, and have pragmatically used MBT for end-to-end test automation of several large web and mobile applications under test. The MBT approach has provided, so far in our project, various tangible and intangible benefits in terms of improved test coverage (number of paths tested), improved test-design practices, and also improved real-fault detection effectiveness. The goal of this experience report (applied research report), done based on ?action research?, is to share our experience of applying and evaluating MBT as a software technology (technique and tool) in a real industrial setting. We aim at contributing to the body of empirical evidence in industrial application of MBT by sharing our industry-academia project on applying MBT in practice, the insights that we have gained, and the challenges and questions that we have faced and tackled so far. We discuss an overview of the industrial setting, provide motivation, explain the events leading to the outcomes, discuss the challenges faced, summarize the outcomes, and conclude with lessons learned, take-away messages, and practical advices based on the described experience. By learning from the best practices in this paper, other test engineers could conduct more mature MBT in their test projects.",0
On the Experiences of Adopting Automated Data Validation in an Industrial Machine Learning Project,"Background: Data errors are a common challenge in machine learning (ML) projects and generally cause significant performance degradation in ML-enabled software systems. To ensure early detection of erroneous data and avoid training MLmodels using bad data, research and industrial practice suggest incorporating a data validation process and tool in the ML system development process. Aim: The study investigates the adoption of a data validation process and tool in industrial ML projects. The data validation process demands significant engineering resources for tool development and maintenance. Thus, it is important to identify the best practices for their adoption especially by development teams that are in the early phases of deploying ML-enabled software systems. Method: Action research was conducted at a large-software intensive organization in telecommunications, specifically within the analytics R&D organization for an ML use case of classifying faults from returned hardware telecommunication devices. Results: Based on the evaluation results and learning from our action research, we identified three best practices, three benefits, and two barriers to adopting the data validation process and tool in ML projects. We also propose a data validation framework(DVF) for systematizing the adoption of a data validation process. Conclusions: The results show that adopting a data validation process and tool in ML projects is an effective approach to testing ML-enabled software systems. It requires having an overview of the level of data (feature, dataset, cross-dataset, data stream) at which certain data quality tests can be applied.",0
Automotive UX design and data-driven development: Narrowing the gap to support practitioners,"The development and evaluation of In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs) is strongly based on insights from qualitative studies conducted in artificial contexts (e.g., driving simulators or lab experiments). However, the growing complexity of the systems and the uncertainty about the context in which they are used, create a need to augment qualitative data with quantitative data, collected during real-world driving. In contrast to many digital companies that are already successfully using data-driven methods, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are not yet succeeding in releasing the potentials such methods offer. We aim to understand what prevents automotive OEMs from applying data-driven methods, what needs practitioners formulate, and how collecting and analyzing usage data from vehicles can enhance UX activities. We adopted a Multiphase Mixed Methods approach comprising two interview studies with more than 15 UX practitioners and two action research studies conducted with two different OEMs. From the four studies, we synthesize the needs of UX designers, extract limitations within the domain that hinder the application of data-driven methods, elaborate on unleveraged potentials, and formulate recommendations to improve the usage of vehicle data. We conclude that, in addition to modernizing the legal, technical, and organizational infrastructure, UX and Data Science must be brought closer together by reducing silo mentality and increasing interdisciplinary collaboration. New tools and methods need to be developed and UX experts must be empowered to make data-based evidence an integral part of the UX design process.",0
Realizing the systematic reuse of automated acceptance tests in practice,"Context: Automated acceptance testing has become a relevant practice of agile software development (e.g., Extreme Programming). Automated acceptance tests (AATs) are closely tied to requirements and provide a mechanism for continuous validation of requirements as system-level tests. Studies have shown that these tests are costly to develop, maintain, and reuse.Objectives: This thesis examines and supports the systematic reuse of automated acceptance tests by providing approaches to search, identity, adapt reusable test cases while considering the reuse costs. Additionally, the maintainability and usage of automated acceptance tests in largescale software projects are studied.Method: We used various research methods to investigate development, reuse, and maintaining the automated acceptance tests. Workshops and interviews of practitioners were used to identify the benefits and challenges of automated acceptance tests. Next, method engineering was used to construct a systematic reuse process for automated acceptance tests. Qualitative feedback collected using a survey, and industrial demonstration examined the reuse process?s performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and necessary facilitating conditions. Two systematic literature reviews are used to identify techniques to adapt tests for future reuse opportunities and calculate the reuse costs of automated acceptance tests. Later, we developed and evaluated an approach for refactoring behavior-driven development-based automated acceptance tests using action research.Results: A cost-aware systematic reuse process was constructed to support the reuse of automated acceptance tests containing eleven activities. For each activity, guidelines on expected input, expected output, the actors performing the activity, and techniques (automated using scripts) are suggested and evaluated. The techniques involve approaches to support development for reuse and methods to calculate the costs of reusing automated acceptance tests. The industrial evaluation of the reuse process and the techniques showed its usefulness and relevance for the industry. Furthermore, seven challenges (i.e., the scale of the software projects, ownership, lack of competence, cost benefits, specification of behaviors in large-scale projects, difficulty writing system-level test-cases, and versioning control of behaviors) and five benefits (i.e., understanding of a business aspect of requirements, improved quality of requirements, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts in large-scale projects, and help for test organization.) of using automated acceptance tests in large-scale projects are identified with software practitioners? help. Later, we proposed a semiautomated four-step approach for pre-processing, measuring, ranking, and identifying refactoring candidates. The approach and the two proposed measures were successfully evaluated using two industrial projects. It was noted that similarity measures could support the maintenance of the specification base using refactoring.Conclusions: The studies show that automated acceptance tests are reusable and can be refactored using our proposed approach. The evaluation shows that the results apply to the software industry in the evaluated context. However, further work is required to evaluate the reuse process in different contexts.",0
"The Diversity of Gamification Evaluation in the Software Engineering Education and Industry: Trends, Comparisons and Gaps","Context: gamification has been used to motivate and engage participants in software engineering education and practice activities. Problem: There is a significant demand for empirical studies for the understanding of the impacts and efficacy of gamification. However, the lack of standard procedures and models for the evaluation of gamification is a challenge for the design, comparison, and report of results related to the assessment of gamification approaches and its effects. Goal: The goal of this study is to identify models and strategies for the evaluation of gamification reported in the literature. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted a systematic mapping study to investigate strategies for the evaluation of gamification in the context of software engineering. We selected 100 primary studies on gamification in software engineering (from 2011 to 2020). We categorized the studies regarding the presence of evaluation procedures or models for the evaluation of gamification, the purpose of the evaluation, the criteria used, the type of data, instruments, and procedures for data analysis. Results: Our results show that 64 studies report procedures for the evaluation of gamification. However, only three studies actually propose evaluation models for gamification. We observed that the evaluation of gamification focuses on two aspects: the evaluation of the gamification strategy itself, related to the user experience and perceptions; and the evaluation of the outcomes and effects of gamification on its users and context. The most recurring criteria for the evaluation are ""engagement"", ""performance"", ""satisfaction"", and ""motivation"". Finally, the evaluation of gamification requires a mix of subjective and objective inputs, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches. Depending of the focus of the evaluation (the strategy or the outcomes), there is a predominance of a type of data and analysis.",0
Toward Efficient Academia-Industry Collaboration: A Case Study of Joint VR System Development,"Collaborative academia-industry development and evaluation of virtual reality (VR) systems is a mutually beneficial opportunity to investigate VR technology in a real context and conduct user studies with target users. However, such collaboration is rarely performed due to variations in project pace and work methods. In this article, we introduce the process of action research on joint design, development, and evaluation of a collaborative VR system to address industrial needs. The paper further presents employees? subjective opinions and perceived value of industrial VR applications and reflects on their involvement throughout the process. The article concludes with a process-oriented framework for remote academia-industry collaboration, supported with practical suggestions on how to support this collaboration. Our experiences reveal the methods and advantages of remote collaboration in all phases of the process and signify the efficiency of the remote framework for academia-industry collaboration, especially relevant in the light of the COVID-19 pandemia..",0
From Blackboard to the Office: A Look Into How Practitioners Perceive Software Testing Education,"The teaching-learning process may require specific pedagogical approaches to establish a relationship with industry practices. Recently, some studies investigated the educators? perspectives and the undergraduate courses curriculum to identify potential weaknesses and solutions for the software testing teaching process. However, it is still unclear how the practitioners evaluate the acquisition of knowledge about software testing in undergraduate courses. This study carried out an expert survey with 68 newly graduated practitioners to determine what the industry expects from them and what they learned in academia. The yielded results indicated that those practitioners learned at a similar rate as others with a long industry experience. Also, they studied less than half of the 35 software testing topics collected in the survey and took industry-backed extracurricular courses to complement their learning. Additionally, our findings point out a set of implications for future research, as the respondents? learning difficulties (e.g., lack of learning sources) and the gap between academic education and industry expectations (e.g., certifications).",0
Factors for Adopting and Implementing Accessibility as a Cornerstone in Software Development Processes in Organizations,"Due to the increasing prevalence of laws, standards, and ethical discussions about web accessibility, developing websites and apps that are usable to everyone?regardless of disability and impairment?is more important than ever. In spite of this, most of the web is still inaccessible and accessibility is commonly treated as an afterthought. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how to implement web accessibility as a cornerstone of software development processes, and more specifically what motivates accessibility adoption and how to implement it successfully.The main part of the research consists of an extensive analysis of the literature to identify common themes. Although legislation and financial concerns play a role in why organizations adopt accessibility, the most frequently cited factors are social and ethical aspects as well as reaching a wider audience. The success of accessibility implementation is largely dependent on how knowledge is created, maintained, and disseminated in organizations. Prioritizing it and integrating it as much as any other basic requirement is also a key to success. Moreover, WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the recommended accessibility standard and compliance level, as informed by a law review and insights from literature. In addition, semi-structured interviews and a workshop were conducted with participants across three projects of a Swedish IT company with the aim of applying the findings in a real-life context and bringing about change in the organization.Final suggestions were based on the thematic analysis, and adapted to the case company through the insights from interviews and the workshop, as well as process documentation and corporate policies. Although not generalizable to all organizations, the suggestions provide understanding of enterprises sharing the case company?s characteristics. Furthermore, the thematic analysis and law review have relevance for all types of private organizations.",0
Concept Analysis in Programming Language Research: Done Well It is All Right,"Programming language research is becoming method conscious. Rigorous mathematical or empirical evaluation is often demanded, which is a good thing. However, I argue in this essay that concept analysis is a legitimate research approach in programming languages, with important limitations. It can be used to sharpen vague concepts, and to expose distinctions that have previously been overlooked, but it does not demonstrate the superiority of one language design over another. Arguments and counter-arguments are essential to successful concept analysis, and such thoughtful conversations should be published more.",0
"Exploring the Interconnectivity of Risk Management, the Human Element, and Action Research: A Canadian Arctic Perspective","In recent decades, the shipping industry, described by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) [1] as ?the most international of all the world?s great industries and one of the most dangerous? (p. 401) has undergone significant change and momentous growth, improved training, and substantial regulatory oversight. Extensive risk management (RM) protocol notwithstanding, accidents still occur [2, 3], with 75% deriving from human factors [4, 5]. In a fundamentally people-based industry, RM and the Human Element, and therefore potential Human Error (HE), are intrinsically linked. Maritime RM is highly regulated with the ISM Code, MARPOL, SOLAS, and the IMO?s Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) process all examples of the regulations and guidelines designed to proactively offset risk and prevent tragedy. Nevertheless, traditional maritime sector RM protocol relies heavily upon historical data which, in addition to the inherent undesirability of dependency, involves multiple other weaknesses. HE has been likened to a breakdown in technical reliability [7] where humans, in their susceptibility to inappropriate response in the face of disturbances to normal operations, act essentially as risk factors [6]. Recent perspectives on safety increasingly consider the Human Element as only one of a ?network of errors? in a safety causation chain [7, p. 14]. In the Arctic, where unknowns are extensive and experience navigating them is not, this distinction is especially noteworthy. Strengthened and deeper connection with the Human Element, in conjunction with databank reinforcement and population, therefore appear fundamental to safety improvement efforts [6]. With particular focus on the Arctic, this paper explores whether Action Research is an appropriate methodology to (i) improve facilitation of tasks identified as necessary to mitigating the insufficiency of existing historical databases and (ii) contribute to safety improvement efforts and augment current RM protocol by bringing together the knowledge base of maritime stakeholders as representatives of the Human Element. 18th Annual General Assembly 2017 International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU)",0
Data management and Data Pipelines: An empirical investigation in the embedded systems domain,"Context: Companies are increasingly collecting data from all possible sources to extract insights that help in data-driven decision-making. Increased data volume, variety, and velocity and the impact of poor quality data on the development of data products are leading companies to look for an improved data management approach that can accelerate the development of high-quality data products. Further, AI is being applied in a growing number of fields, and thus it is evolving as a horizontal technology. Consequently, AI components are increasingly been integrated into embedded systems along with electronics and software. We refer to these systems as AI-enhanced embedded systems. Given the strong dependence of AI on data, this expansion also creates a new space for applying data management techniques.  Objective: The overall goal of this thesis is to empirically identify the data management challenges encountered during the development and maintenance of AI-enhanced embedded systems, propose an improved data management approach and empirically validate the proposed approach. Method: To achieve the goal, we conducted this research in close collaboration with Software Center companies using a combination of different empirical research methods: case studies, literature reviews, and action research. Results and conclusions: This research provides five main results. First, it identifies key data management challenges specific to Deep Learning models developed at embedded system companies. Second, it examines the practices such as DataOps and data pipelines that help to address data management challenges. We observed that DataOps is the best data management practice that improves the data quality and reduces the time tdevelop data products. The data pipeline is the critical component of DataOps that manages the data life cycle activities. The study also provides the potential faults at each step of the data pipeline and the corresponding mitigation strategies. Finally, the data pipeline model is realized in a small piece of data pipeline and calculated the percentage of saved data dumps through the implementation. Future work: As future work, we plan to realize the conceptual data pipeline model so that companies can build customized robust data pipelines. We also plan to analyze the impact and value of data pipelines in cross-domain AI systems and data applications. We also plan to develop AI-based fault detection and mitigation system suitable for data pipelines.",0
Inventorying Systems: An Action Research.,"Maintainability, characterized by ease of understanding, is strongly related to the availability of correct and update information about th e system and the ease of maintenance staff in understanding it. The Brazilian public administration has many legacy systems in maintenance whose documentation is non-existent or incomplete. The main purpose of this work was to identify the inventorying attributes that have to be recorded to support systems maintenance. The me thodology applied was action research whose cycles allowed identifying the attributes required by each one of the stakeholders, civil servants and providers to inventory the systems, as well as how to register and access their attributes. As a result, the set of attributes produced by the interaction between researchers and stakeholders was considered essential to the infrastructure and systems areas, managers, and providers.",0
Towards Lean Service sustainability: an action research approach,"This thesis argues that the sustainability of Lean philosophy adoption depends on following a systemic and holistic thinking, combining Lean technical and social dimensions. Based on the constructivism research paradigm, the study was supported on the Action Research methodology (AR), particularly the Canonical Action Research method (CAR). Acknowledging on lessons learned from two research cycles, the evolving approach to applying and sustaining Lean in a financial services provider was performed. The result was positive and the innovative approach followed was coined as Lean Service System Approach (LSSA). It combines the standard roadmap in Lean Leap model with Lean Service Critical Success Factors, covering the four perspectives of organisation, people, process and customer, within continuous improvement cycles. This approach was able to anchor Lean in the organisation over time and answered the research question of how to sustain Lean thinking in service organisations. Future research perspectives were also identified to foster further contributions to the Lean community, practitioners and academia.",0

"Approaches, success factors, and barriers for technology transfer in software engineering?Results of a systematic literature review","Abstract Introduction Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application. Objective This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering. Method We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis. Results Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer. Conclusion Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.",0
Start With Problems or Solutions? Medical Device Design in Industry and Academia,"Design processes can be influenced by their practice environments. Although design processes of industry engineers have been examined in multiple research studies, few studies have investigated design processes of academic engineers. As academia and industry have different sociocultural norms and constraints, their design processes likely also differ. To examine this question, we conducted semi-structured interviews with both academic and industry engineers who had successfully designed medical devices. Our qualitative findings revealed that engineers in industry described their design process as a sequence with problem definition, solution exploration, detail design, evaluation, and communication. Academic engineers, in contrast, described their design process as beginning with a discovered solution, then searching for application problems, evaluating compatibility between problems and solution, and finally, communicating their findings through publications. Understanding differences in design processes of academic and industry engineers can facilitate knowledge sharing and promote collaboration between academia and industry. The findings also highlight the impact of sociocultural norms on practices, even in disciplines with highly trained and clearly defined processes.",0
Empirical study of the evaluation of perspectives to knowledge capitalisation in Brazilian software industry,"Knowledge capitalisation directs the activities of use, exploitation and reuse of knowledge for performing new tasks, including technical and management aspects. Specifically, considering software development, knowledge capitalisation demands an analysis that considers four complementary and interdependent perspectives on knowledge: value, security, utility and status. These perspectives focus on different facets according to which knowledge can be analysed, in addition to provide a foundation for a better awareness on knowledge and the necessary treatment. This study presents an empirical study with the purpose of evaluating the relevance of these perspectives by using a survey questionnaire distributed to software development companies in the Brazilian market. Three hundred thirty nine individuals from different 339 companies were subjects of such a study. The results indicate that the perspectives are relevant for evaluating knowledge and reinforcing the relevance of exploring knowledge capitalisation in software development; therefore, there is a clear understanding of how the knowledge assets involved can be analysed or assessed.",0

"Scaling agile in large organizations: Practices, challenges, and success factors","Abstract Context: Agile software development has nowadays reached wide adoption. However, moving agile to large-scale contexts is a complex task with many challenges involved. Objective: In this paper, we review practices, challenges, and success factors for scaling agile both from literature and within a large software company, identifying the most critical factors. Method: We conduct a focused literature review to map the importance of scaling practices, challenges, and success factors. The outcome of this focused literature review is used to guide action research within a software company with a view to scaling agile processes. Results: Company culture, prior agile and lean experience, management support, and value unification were found to be key success factors during the action research process. Resistance to change, an overly aggressive roll-out time frame, quality assurance concerns, and integration into preexisting nonagile business processes were found to be the critical challenges in the scaling process. Conclusion: The action research process allowed to cross-fertilize ideas from literature to the company's context. Scaling agile within an organization does not need to follow a specific scheme, rather the process can be tailored to the needs while keeping the core values and principles of agile methodologies.",0
University-industry collaboration and open source software (OSS) dataset in mining software repositories (MSR) research,"Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is an applied and practise-oriented field aimed at solving real problems encountered by practitioners and bringing value to Industry. We believe that empirical studies on both Open Source Software (OSS) and Closed or Proprietary Source (CSS/PSS) is required in MSR research to increase generalizability or transferability of findings and reduce external (or threats) validity concerns. Furthermore, we believe that a collaboration between University and Industry is must or important in achieving the stated goals and agenda of MSR research (such as deployment and technology transfer). We analyse past five years of research papers published in MSR series of conferences (2010-2014) and count the number of studies using solely OSS data or solely CSS data or both OSS and CSS data. We also count the number of papers published by authors solely from Universities, solely from Industry and from both University and Industry. We present our findings which indicate lack of University-Industry collaboration (measured using co-authorship in scientific publications) and paucity of empirical studies on CSS/PSS data. Our analysis reveals that out of 187 studies over a period of 5 years, 90:9% studies are conducted solely on OSS dataset. We present our findings which indicate that only 14:43% of the studies involve a University-Industry collaboration.",0
A bibliometric analysis of the Turkish software engineering research community,"This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the Turkish software engineering (SE) community (researchers and institutions). The bibliometric analysis has been conducted based on the number of papers published in the software-engineering-related venues and indexed in the Scopus academic search engine until year 2014. According to the bibliometric analysis, the top-ranked institution is Middle East Technical University, and the top-ranked scholar is Ay{\c{s}}e Ba{\c{s}}ar Bener (formerly with Bo{\u{g}}azi{\c{c}}i University and now with Ryerson University in Canada). The analysis reveals other important findings and presents a set of implications for the Turkish SE community and stakeholders (e.g., funding agencies and decision makers) such as the followings: (1) Turkey produces only about 0.49 {\%} of the world-wide SE knowledge, as measured by the number of papers in Scopus, which is very negligible unfortunately. To take a more active role in the global SE community, the Turkish SE community has to increase their outputs. (2) We notice a lack of diversity in the general SE spectrum, e.g., we noticed very little focus on requirements engineering, software maintenance and evolution, and architecture. This denotes the need to further diversification in SE research topics in Turkey. (3) In total, 89 papers in the pool (30.8 {\%} of the total) are internationally-authored SE papers. Having a good level of international collaborations is a good sign for the Turkish SE community. The highest international collaborations have been with researchers from United States, Canada and Netherlands. (4) In general, the involvement of industry in SE search is low. All stakeholders (e.g., government, industry and academia) should aim at increasing the level of industry-academia collaboration in the Turkish SE community, (5) Citation to Turkish SE papers, in general, are significantly lower than a set of three representative pools of SE papers. This is an area of concern which needs further investigation, and (6) In general, there is a need to increase both the quantity and quality of the Turkish SE papers, in the global stage. The approach we use in this study could be replicated in other countries to provide insights and trends about the SE research performance in other countries.",0
A Survey of Types of Industry-Academia Collaboration,"Collaborations between industry and academia are, when properly designed and managed, beneficial to both the industry partners and the academic institutions. Such collaborations may take place on both small and large scales, and may involve varying numbers of academic institutions and industry partners. They may also have different purposes, including both research-focused collaborative efforts and programs designed to connect undergraduate students with real-world projects to enhance their education. In this paper, the authors will provide a survey of different models of industry-academia collaboration in engineering and engineering technology. The paper will include both a survey of existing literature on the topic as well as a survey of publicly available information on existing collaborations. While the primary focus is on collaborations within the United States, some literature on international collaborations will also be included in the survey. It will discuss several different collaboration models, and what factors appear to be significant in those collaborations. Finally, it will conclude with recommendations that can be used to study specific aspects of industry-academia collaborations.",0
An Improved Indoor Positioning Method Based on Received Signal Strengths,"With the economy developing rapidly, Location Based Service (LBS) has attracted more and more people's attention. Indoor positioning methods based on WLAN and RSS with advantage of low cost are most widely used. In this paper, we propose an improved indoor positioning method based on received signal strength to obtain better accuracy. We apply selected weighed K nearest neighbor (WSKNN) to get a better initial point of the gradient-descent-based location search (GLS) which is combined with exhaustive location search (ELS) to achieve a better result. Experimental results conducted in the real environments show that our proposed algorithm can obtain improvement of the mean error distance of 7.17% and 22.54%, compared with the GLS-CF method and traditional KNN method, respectively.",0

Suspense as a Driver for University-Industry Collaboration,"The rise of shared global challenges has increased the importance of joint innovation efforts. University-Industry Collaborations (UICs) represent an underexplored opportunity for multi-company initiatives. This article explores how universities can adapt their collaboration offerings toward industry partners so as to better facilitate innovation ecosystems. An empathic design approach was used to examine X!Delft?s ecosystem ? part of the valorisation centre of the Delft University of Technology. This revealed one underlying emotional driver of industry partners for participation, namely a shared sense of ?suspense? regarding future (technological) developments. Hence, a framework was created to stimulate enduring engagement by cultivating effective suspense.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",0
Capturing Cost Avoidance through Reuse: Systematic Literature Review and Industrial Evaluation,"Background: Cost avoidance through reuse shows the benefits gained by the software organisations when reusing an artefact. Cost avoidance captures benefits that are not captured by cost savings e.g. spending that would have increased in the absence of the cost avoidance activity. This type of benefit can be combined with quality aspects of the product e.g. costs avoided because of defect prevention. Cost avoidance is a key driver for software reuse. Objectives: The main objectives of this study are: (1) To assess the status of capturing cost avoidance through reuse in the academia; (2) Based on the first objective, propose improvements in capturing of reuse cost avoidance, integrate these into an instrument, and evaluate the instrument in the software industry. Method: The study starts with a systematic literature review (SLR) on capturing of cost avoidance through reuse. Later, a solution is proposed and evaluated in the industry to address the shortcomings identified during the systematic literature review. Results: The results of a systematic literature review describe three previous studies on reuse cost avoidance and show that no solution, to capture reuse cost avoidance, was validated in industry. Afterwards, an instrument and a data collection form are proposed that can be used to capture the cost avoided by reusing any type of reuse artefact. The instrument and data collection form (describing guidelines) were demonstrated to a focus group, as part of static evaluation. Based on the feedback, the instrument was updated and evaluated in industry at 6 development sites, in 3 different countries, covering 24 projects in total. Conclusion: The proposed solution performed well in industrial evaluation. With this solution, practitioners were able to do calculations for reuse costs avoidance and use the results as decision support for identifying potential artefacts to reuse.",0
Semantic knowledge management system to support software engineers: implementation and static evaluation through interviews at ericsson,"Background: In large-scale corporations in the software engineering context information overload problems occur as stakeholders continuously produce useful information on process life-cycle issues, matters related to specific products under development, etc. Information overload makes finding relevant information (e.g., how did the company apply the requirements process for product X?) challenging, which is in the primary focus of this paper. Contribution: In this study the authors aimed at evaluating the ease of implementing a semantic knowledge management system at Ericsson, including the essential components of such systems (such as text processing, ontologies, semantic annotation and semantic search). Thereafter, feedback on the usefulness of the system was collected from practitioners. Method: A single case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB in Sweden. Results: It was found that semantic knowledge management systems are challenging to implement, this refers in particular to the implementation and integration of ontologies. Specific ontologies for structuring and filtering are essential, such as domain ontologies and ontologies distinct to the organization. Conclusion: To be readily adopted and transferable to practice, desired ontologies need to be implemented and integrated into semantic knowledge management frameworks with ease, given that the desired ontologies are dependent on organizations and domains.",0
Systematic literature reviews in agile software development: A tertiary study,"Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.",0
Using a Visual Abstract as a Lens for Communicating and Promoting Design Science Research in Software Engineering,"Empirical software engineering research aims to generate prescriptive knowledge that can help software engineers improve their work and overcome their challenges, but deriving these insights from real-world problems can be challenging. In this paper, we promote design science as an effective way to produce and communicate prescriptive knowledge. We propose using a visual abstract template to communicate design science contributions and highlight the main problem/solution constructs of this area of research, as well as to present the validity aspects of design knowledge. Our conceptualization of design science is derived from existing literature and we illustrate its use by applying the visual abstract to an example use case. This is work in progress and further evaluation by practitioners and researchers will be forthcoming.",0
On the search for industry-relevant regression testing research,"Regression testing is a means to assure that a change in the software, or its execution environment, does not introduce new defects. It involves the expensive undertaking of rerunning test cases. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of test cases to execute in regression testing, however, there is no research on how to assess industrial relevance and applicability of such techniques. We conducted a systematic literature review with the following two goals: firstly, to enable researchers to design and present regression testing research with a focus on industrial relevance and applicability and secondly, to facilitate the industrial adoption of such research by addressing the attributes of concern from the practitioners' perspective. Using a reference-based search approach, we identified 1068 papers on regression testing. We then reduced the scope to only include papers with explicit discussions about relevance and applicability (i.e. mainly studies involving industrial stakeholders). Uniquely in this literature review, practitioners were consulted at several steps to increase the likelihood of achieving our aim of identifying factors important for relevance and applicability. We have summarised the results of these consultations and an analysis of the literature in three taxonomies, which capture aspects of industrial-relevance regarding the regression testing techniques. Based on these taxonomies, we mapped 38 papers reporting the evaluation of 26 regression testing techniques in industrial settings.",0
Machine learning software engineering in practice: An industrial case study,"SAP is the market leader in enterprise software offering an end-to-end suite of applications and services to enable their customers worldwide to operate their business. Especially, retail customers of SAP deal with millions of sales transactions for their day-to-day business. Transactions are created during retail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and then sent to some central servers for validations and other business operations. A considerable proportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies due to many technical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error detection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using workbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to further errors due to incorrect modifications. This is not only a performance overhead on the customers' business workflow but it also incurs high operational costs. Thus, automated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important regarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business workflow. In this paper, we present an industrial case study where we apply machine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. We identify and discuss the challenges that we faced during this collaborative research and development project, from three distinct perspectives: Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and industry-academia collaboration. We report on our experience and insights from the project with guidelines for the identified challenges. We believe that our findings and recommendations can help researchers and practitioners embarking into similar endeavors.",0
Botched Releases: Do We Need to Roll Back? Empirical Study on a Commercial Web App,"Few minutes after a web-based software release, the release team might encounter log traces showing the new system crashing, hanging, or having poor performance. This is the start of the most nerve-wrecking moments of a product's release cycle, i.e., should one run the risk of not doing anything and users losing precious data, or of prematurely engaging the tedious (and costly) roll-back procedure towards the previous release? Thus far, only little attention has been paid by researchers to these so-called ""botched releases"", partly because of lack of release log data. This paper studies 345 releases of a large e-commerce web app over a period of 1.5 years, in which we identified 17 recurrent root causes of botched releases, classified into four major categories. We then build explanatory models to understand which root causes are the most important, and to explore the factors leading to botched releases.",0
Academy-industry collaboration and the effects of the involvement of undergraduate students in real world activities,"As stated by the IEEE Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering, elements outside the classroom such as field trips, visits to industry and technical presentations can affect student's preparation for professional practice. This work describes a framework of academy-industry collaboration where students develop practical and academic activities in a real world scenario. It is a methodological research, in which a case study was conducted with a Government Agency that has a close collaboration with a University. This joint project led to the proposition of new software processes for the organization and produced research and capstone project papers. Results demonstrate that students have acquired experience in solving real world problems in the industry; they received recognition in the academic community through the acceptance of papers in international conferences; and also, the projects executed with the students produced outcomes that brought benefits to the government agency, under study.",0
Measuring Software Reliability: A Trend Using Machine Learning Techniques,"It has become inevitable for every software developer to understand, to follow that how and why software fails, and to express reliability in quantitative terms. This has led to a proliferation of software reliability models to estimate and predict reliability. The basic approach is to model past failure data to predict future behavior. Most of the models have three major components: assumptions, factors and a mathematical function, usually high order exponential or logarithmic used to relate factors to reliability. Software reliability models are used to forecast the curve of failure rate by statistical evidence available during testing phase. They also can indicate about the extra time required to carry out the test procedure in order to meet the specifications and deliver desired functionality with minimum number of defects. Therefore there are challenges whether, autonomous or machine learning techniques like other predictive methods could be able to forecast the reliability measures for a specific software application. This chapter contemplates reliability issue through a generic Machine Learning paradigm while referring the most common aspects of Support Vector Machine scenario. Couples of customized simulation and experimental results have been presented to support the proposed reliability measures and strategies.",0
Codex: A metamodel ontology to guide the execution of coding experiments,"Background: Experiments have been conducted in many domains of software engineering (SE). Objective: This paper presents a metamodel, the Codex metamodel, containing standard concepts found in any coding experiment. We classify coding experiments as any SE experiment where participants have to carry out coding activities (construct, test, debug, and forth). Method: The paper presents results of an exploratory study that proposes a metamodel for the domain of coding experiments. Besides, we present how our metamodel specifies a real coding experiment. Results: Our metamodel for coding experiments was modeled with few elements, and it can precisely describe all coding activities. Conclusions: Our metamodel facilitates the development of a tool to support executing a coding experiment.",0
Empirical Studies in Question-Answering Systems: A Discussion,"Researchers perform empirical studies in industry to gain qualitative insights into a real-world problem. However, common critics are the diversity and selection process of participants. To address these issues, we propose to improve the integration of question-answering systems into empirical study. In this paper, we i) describe approaches to conduct studies in such systems, ii) exemplify corresponding challenges, and iii) discuss their potential. We illustrate the approaches on existing works in which they were partly implemented to show that they can succeed.",0
Toward Improving Industrial Adoption: The Choice of Programming Languages and Development Environments,"While promising software engineering approaches are proposed every day, only few are adapted by professional developers. There are many potential reasons for this, such as, problems in identifying helpful approaches, missing tools, or lacking practical relevance. With our current research, we are concerned to improve the knowledge transfer from research to practice. In this paper, we discuss the impact of development environments and programming languages on knowledge transfer ? considering that many scientific approaches and tools are interesting for professional developers, but rarely adopted by them. We base our discussion mainly on our personal experiences with industry-academia collaborations. To determine whether these experiences also apply to other developers, we additionally conducted a survey with 89 participants from academia and industry. The first results of our on-going work indicate a gap between the development environments and programming languages that are supported or used by researchers and those that are applied in industry. Based on our results, we describe initial discussions that can help to improve collaborations between industry and research.",0
Gap between academia and industry: a case of empirical evaluation of three software testing methods,"Doing the right kind of testing has always been one of main challenging and a decisive task for industry. To choose right software testing method(s), industry needs to have an exact objective knowledge of their effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability conditions. The most common way to evaluate testing methods, for such knowledge, is with empirical studies. Reliable and comprehensive evidence can be obtained by aggregating the results of different empirical studies (family of experiments) taking into account their findings and limitations. We conducted a study to investigate the current state of the art of empirical knowledge base of three testing methods. We found that although the empirical studies conducted so far to evaluate testing methods contain many important and interesting results; however, we still lack factual and generalizable knowledge about performance and applicability conditions of testing methods(s), making it unfeasible to be readily adopted by the industry. Moreover, we tried to identify the major factors responsible for limiting academia from producing significantly reliable results having an industrial impact. We believe that besides effective and long-term academia-industry collaboration, there is a need for more systematic, quantifiable and comprehensive empirical studies (which provides scope for aggregation using rigorous techniques), mainly replications so as to create an effective and applicable knowledge base about testing methods which potentially can fill the gap between academia and industry.",0

The University Challenge in the Collaboration Relationship With the Industry,"Universities suffer from the impact of (1) life cycles associated with technological innovations, (2) the globalization of the economy and culture, (3) the educational needs of an increasingly knowledge-driven society, and (4) the training needs for high-performing professional activities. Solutions to these factors may be found in a positive attitude toward knowledge sharing and collaboration relationships. Collaboration has been considered a way to address the challenges of the 21st century, fostering the necessary innovation, growth, and productivity for all parties involved. Several studies reveal that collaboration can be strongly influenced by knowledge sharing. Collaboration relationships, besides the creation of new knowledge, may result in several outcomes and benefits for the university and society. This chapter aims to address and discuss the university challenges in the collaboration relationships with the industry based on the main results of some empirical studies developed during a research project.",0
Guidelines for conducting interactive rapid reviews in software engineering -- from a focus on technology transfer to knowledge exchange,"Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) aims to improve research utilization in practice. It relies on systematic methods (like systematic literature reviews, systematic mapping studies, and rapid reviews) to identify, appraise, and synthesize existing research findings to answer questions of interest. However, the lack of practitioners' involvement in the design, execution, and reporting of these methods indicates a lack of appreciation for knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners. Within EBSE, the main reason for conducting these systematic studies is to answer the practitioner's questions and impact practice. However, in many cases, academics have undertaken these studies without any direct involvement of practitioners.This report focuses on the rapid review guidelines and presents practical advice on conducting these with practitioner involvement to facilitate knowledge co-creation.Based on a literature review of rapid reviews and stakeholders engagement in medicine and our experience of using secondary studies in software engineering, we propose extensions to an existing proposal for rapid reviews in software engineering to increase researchers-practitioners knowledge exchange. We refer to the extended method as an interactive rapid review.An interactive rapid review is a streamlined approach to conduct agile literature reviews in close collaboration between researchers and practitioners in software engineering. This report describes the process and discusses possible usage scenarios and some reflections from the proposal's ongoing evaluation.The proposed guidelines will potentially boost knowledge co-creation through active researcher-practitioner interaction by streamlining practitioners' involvement and recognizing the need for an agile process.",0
Heuristic Approaches to Improve Product Quality in Large Scale Integrated Software Products,"Software quality has always been an important criterion for assessing stability of a product. It is quite challenging for large-scale complex products, especially integrated products, to endure and withstand the competition after a new version release in its market domain. Unlike regular software, integrated software products require detailed exploration on the spread and impact of a defect to improve overall product quality. In this paper, we use heuristic approaches like generalized defect dependency approach, control flow graph based approach, and feature correlation based approach to study the widespread of defects in large software and suggest a metric called defect dependency metric to study the dependency of defects. We implemented the generalized defect dependency approach on an industry dataset and gathered noteworthy results. We provide a comparative a study of the heuristic approaches and comprehended their individual usage with observations. We further discuss the need of adoption of such vision in industries as a standard testing practice to improve quality.",0
What do software team managers want from a skills identification?,"Searching for developers with the necessary skills to work effectively on a project is not an easy task for companies. For software team managers, it is important to know their team's experience and what technologies they are using in order to be able to allocate resources optimally. Therefore, in this paper, we decided to study the needs of the managers of a software development company in order to identify their team's skills. We carried out a focus group. We have interviewed 11 managers from a development company (with approximately 75 developers). As result we have mapped 5 issues, 4 possible applications and another 7 needs to create a new methodology for identifying skills. Finally, we conclude that managers are interested in a methodology to identify skills in business flow.",0
From Ivory Tower to Democratization and Industrialization: A Landscape View of Real-World Adaptation of Artificial Intelligence,"Deep learning is a hot research topic during 2010s. The rapid advances and data and computing-intensive characteristics of deep learning isolated ordinary people from the technology. However, as the technology advances, there are some visible signs of socialization in deep learning. The author presents the concept of democratization and industrialization of deep learning. Then, the author describes this trend as a new landscape view of AI technology. Finally, the author describes a 3-stage model of interaction between social community and technology in the era of digital transformation.",0
An Industrial Case Study on Improving Quality in Integrated Software Product using defect dependency.,"Product based organizations have diverse product offerings that meet various business needs. The products are in turn integrated to create integrated product suites. Rigorous product engineering is a must for creation of high quality integrated software products. Adequate measures must be taken to improve quality of the integrated product before every release of its module or sub-product. It is hard to imagine upgrading an integrated software product with unidentified defects prior to its release. In this paper, we share our observations on implementing a defect dependency metric to identify the dependency of a defect over a real-time industry defect dataset of an integrated software product. This defect dependency metric was captured and analyzed during release cycle(s) to avoid surprise issues post product launch.",0
Challenges and best practices in industry-academia collaborations in software engineering: A systematic literature review,"Context: The global software industry and the software engineering (SE) academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. It seems that the two ?camps? show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations. Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side. Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their collaborations.",0
MeSRAM - A method for assessing robustness of measurement programs in large software development organizations and its industrial evaluation,"Measurement programs in large software development organizations contain a large number of indicators, base and derived measures to monitor products, processes and projects. The diversity and the number of these measures causes the measurement programs to become large, combining multiple needs, measurement tools and organizational goals. For the measurement program to effectively support organizationâ€™s goals, it should be scalable, automated, standardized and flexible â€“ i.e. robust. In this paper we present a method for assessing the robustness of measurement programs. The method is based on the robustness model which has been developed in collaboration between seven companies and a university. The purpose of the method is to support the companies to optimize the value obtained from the measurement programs and their cost. We evaluated the method at the seven companies and the results from applying the method to each company quantified the robustness of their programs, reflecting the real-world status of the programs and pinpointed strengths and improvements of the programs.",0
Benefits and drawbacks of software reference architectures: A case study,"Context Software Reference Architectures (SRAs) play a fundamental role for organizations whose business greatly depends on the efficient development and maintenance of complex software applications. However, little is known about the real value and risks associated with SRAs in industrial practice. Objective To investigate the current industrial practice of SRAs in a single company from the perspective of different stakeholders. Method An exploratory case study that investigates the benefits and drawbacks perceived by relevant stakeholders in nine SRAs designed by a multinational software consulting company. Results The study shows the perceptions of different stakeholders regarding the benefits and drawbacks of SRAs (e.g., both SRA designers and users agree that they benefit from reduced development costs; on the contrary, only application builders strongly highlighted the extra learning curve as a drawback associated with mastering SRAs). Furthermore, some of the SRA benefits and drawbacks commonly highlighted in the literature were remarkably not mentioned as a benefit of SRAs (e.g., the use of best practices). Likewise, other aspects arose that are not usually discussed in the literature, such as higher time-to-market for applications when their dependencies on the SRA are managed inappropriately. Conclusions This study aims to help practitioners and researchers to better understand real SRAs projects and the contexts where these benefits and drawbacks appeared, as well as some SRA improvement strategies. This would contribute to strengthening the evidence regarding SRAs and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about the expected SRA benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, we make available the instruments used in this study and the anonymized data gathered to motivate others to provide similar evidence to help mature SRA research and practice.",0
Collaborative research project networks: Knowledge transfer at the fuzzy front end of innovation,"Many businesses seeking enhanced innovation have corporate research teams that engage in collaborative research projects (CRPs), with external entities such as universities, public organizations, or customers. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests mixed outcomes of CRPs in terms of corporate research impact, which implies successful transfer of novel knowledge generated within CRPs to company-internal business networks to develop radically innovative products. We use the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP) and meta-analysis to analyze six CRP networks. Our findings indicate that the network?s relational characteristics (tie strength) and structural characteristics (network range) are important determinants of knowledge transfer at the fuzzy front end of innovation.",0
Cooperation between knowledge-based institutions and business: empirical studies and network theories,"The issue of broadly-understood ties and collaboration be-tween business and science is one of the key issues con-stituting the foundations for the modern knowledge-based economy, which relies on innovations and competitiveness in technically and scientifically advanced branches. The article outlines the theoretical perspective for studies on the effects of this cooperation. Taking into consideration the richness of the aspects and sub-issues of the problem which should be analysed, the paper implicitly prepares the ?groundwork? for more detailed empirical studies based on the overview of different approaches and methods used in the literature, concluding - not only from the literature but mainly from the special characteristics of the ?start-up world? - that the most suitable theoretical approach for properly con-structed empirical studies is the network theory in general and the social capital perspective in particular. The subject of ?hard? forms of cooperation between science institutions and business (start-ups in particular) requires more insight into the network approach to entrepreneurship. Secondly, the article presents an overview of the literature, concentrat-ing on studies which analyse cooperation between knowl-edge-based entities (universities) and business in practice, as well as a detailed example of one such case study. The case study which was discovered in the literature, namely cooperation between Ericsson and ITU, is related to net-work concepts discussed in the theoretical part.",0
Increasing the impact of industry--academia collaboration through co-production,"Increased competition and globalization motivate us to join forces to enhance the impact of the research conducted. Collaboration between organizations with different views can, however, be difficult to manage and needs awareness and skills to meet different expectations. This article will consider both a mutual industrial and academic perspective into the development of action research and, in six research project cases, empirically explore how the impact can be enhanced by considering certain key factors in the research process. How the phases of problem formulation, methodology, and results are managed is critical for the success of a collaboration and, thereby, its impact. Counter-productive forces that could dilute the progress over time need to be considered given that combining practical relevance and scientific rigour comes with challenges.",0
A survey of types of industry-academia collaboration,"Collaborations between industry and academia are, when properly designed and managed, beneficial to both the industry partners and the academic institutions. Such collaborations may take place on both small and large scales, and may involve varying numbers of academic institutions and industry partners. They may also have different purposes, including both research-focused collaborative efforts and programs designed to connect undergraduate students with real-world projects to enhance their education. In this paper, the authors will provide a survey of different models of industry-academia collaboration in engineering and engineering technology. The paper will include both a survey of existing literature on the topic as well as a survey of publicly available information on existing collaborations. While the primary focus is on collaborations within the United States, some literature on international collaborations will also be included in the survey. It will discuss several different collaboration models, and what factors appear to be significant in those collaborations. Finally, it will conclude with recommendations that can be used to study specific aspects of industry-academia collaborations.",0
Action Research as Research Methodology in Software Engineering,"Compared to other research methodologies, action research is probably the youngest one. It?s been introduced in the middle of the twentieth century and has gained attention ever since. It became popular because it appeals to both researchers and organizations who seek impact and utilization of scientific results in practice. In this chapter, we present the principles of action research and provide concrete guidelines on how to propose an action research project. We elaborate on the main parts of the action research methodology and exemplify them. We show how we can use experiment systems to involve customers in action research, and we finish the chapter by presenting how to manage action research projects.",0
Case studies of industry-academia research collaborations for software development with agile,"Successful industry-academia research collaborations (IARCs) in the software development area can be challenging. The literature identifies best practices in IARCs along with process frameworks with the aim of ensuring successful outcomes for both industry and academia, namely: funding opportunities for universities, training and employment possibilities for students, new knowledge leading to innovative products for industry, and on-time delivery of software benefiting the economy, the institution, and the community. This paper shows ways in which core principles of the project management approach, Agile, and the Scrum framework have been applied and have led to the success of three IARCs. In addition to IARCs? common challenges, these case studies represented additional challenges as they were short-term software development projects accomplished by small geographically distributed teams. A report of the demographic, collaboration setting, and challenges, along with the lessons learned from the application of Agile and Scrum in these case studies will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of IARCs. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, five Agile/Scrum aspects for each project are assessed: product ownership, release, sprint, team, and technical health. Findings indicate several success factors directly linked to the application of the Agile principles and the Scrum framework. Specifically, early and frequent customer-centric software delivery, constant communications, responsiveness to change, and highly motivated individuals were key in terms of realizing the positive outcomes in spite of the obstacles inherent to IARCs. Cautions to this approach when applied in IARCs are reported along with solutions.",0
A Systematic Mapping Study of the Current Practice of Indian Software Engineering,"Systematic mapping studies are an important research method and have been used in software engineering to provide an overview of a research area by a process of classification and counting of the outputs in a particular area. They have also been used to examine the outputs found in specific publication outlets. In this paper, we report on the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to review the entire publication output of the Indian Software Engineering Conference (ISEC) series. We use the outputs of the study to present visual depictions of the nature of Indian Software Engineering academic research from 2008--2015. A second contribution of the work reports on comparison of the ISEC series with that of the pre-eminent international conference in software engineering (ICSE). We contextualise the results within the wider picture of the national Indian IT community.",0
Certus: an organizational effort towards research-based innovation in software verification and validation,"What is gratifying to a software engineering researcher? Three of many possible answers to this question are (a) the intellectual exercise in developing/disseminating approaches that address emerging and existing challenges, (b) recognition from impact in a community of researchers and (c) widespread use of novel ideas, including software, in the society at large leading to enhancement of human ability and job creation. A culmination of these sources requires an organizational effort. This article presents a detailed account of a research-based innovation centre, Certus, to facilitate such a culmination for software engineering researchers. Certus has established a body of knowledge, methods and tools for the validation and verification of software systems in the Norwegian private and public sector. Certus works in close cooperation with five founding user partners and is hosted by the Simula Research Laboratory. We present the organizational structure of Certus and describe how Certus?s life and health is planned and evaluated on a regular basis as a research-based innovation centre. We expound two successful collaborations, with (a) the private sector entity Cisco systems, Norway and (b) the public sector entity the Norwegian Customs and Excise. We hope that this document will serve as a basis to encourage national/international funding schemes to create call for proposals for long-term research-based innovation centres. This, we believe, is one way to justify use of tax payers resources in creating a win?win situation for the triple helix: government, researchers and industry.",0
Exploring the industry's challenges in software testing: An empirical study,"Context: Software testing is an important and costly software engineering activity in the industry. Despite the efforts of the software testing research community in the last several decades, various studies show that still many practitioners in the industry report challenges in their software testing tasks. Objective: To shed light on industry's challenges in software testing, we characterize and synthesize the challenges reported by practitioners. Such concrete challenges can then be used for a variety of purposes, eg, research collaborations between industry and academia. Method: Our empirical research method is opinion survey. By designing an online survey, we solicited practitioners' opinions about their challenges in different testing activities. Our dataset includes data from 72 practitioners from eight different countries. Results:  Our results show that test management and test automation are considered the most challenging among all testing activities by practitioners. Our results also include a set of 104 concrete challenges in software testing that may need further investigations by the research community. Conclusion: We conclude that the focal points of industrial work and academic research in software testing differ. Furthermore, the paper at hand provides valuable insights concerning practitioners' ?pain? points and, thus, provides researchers with a source of important research topics of high practical relevance.",0
Challenges of structured reuse adoption?Lessons learned,"Adoption of structured reuse approaches in practice often poses multiple challenges. Research-industry collaborations are considered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties as well as to validate the applicability of scientific results. However, research co-operations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners in the context of a study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the participating companies had undertaken two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse. However, both attempts did not succeed as expected. In our study, we identified tacit assumptions that were related to the encountered difficulties and present the lessons learned from the adoption approach. Furthermore, we report strategies that helped us to overcome the scepticism caused by a previous unsuccessful guided collaboration.",0
Leading FAIR Adoption Across the Institution: A Collaboration Between an Academic Library and a Technology Provider,"Universities strive to foster knowledge sharing and greater research productivity. Some recognize that this requires research output to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. But current tools do not yet allow a comprehensive adoption of these FAIR principles for making research openly and globally accessible to generate new knowledge. To address this gap, diverse stakeholders are collaborating to build effective research data management [RDM] solutions for institutional research output [publications and data] that benefit researchers, institutions, and developers. This paper illustrates a university-industry collaboration between a private U.S. university (Drexel University) and a global commercial vendor (Ex Libris, a ProQuest company). The authors examine how an emerging technology infrastructure for Research Data Management will enable librarians to help institutions adopt the FAIR principles at scale. They highlight an approach for collaborative product development that aims not to change researcher habits or add to librarians? workloads. Their first year working together confirms factors recognized as contributing to successful collaborations, such as aligning goals, building understanding of each other?s organizations, and sustaining honest engagement. Though FAIR offers a simple articulation to help build campus infrastructure and change culture, its implementation will vary between different groups of researchers. Libraries and technology providers have a mutual interest in collaborating to address RDM challenges, but must recognize that collaboration takes time, perseverance, and flexibility to effect change. Librarians, researchers, and administrators from such campus offices as Research, Compliance, IT, Legal, and Graduate Studies will benefit from key lessons raised by this case study.",0
Deploying TESTAR to enable remote testing in an industrial CI pipeline: a case-based evaluation,"Companies are facing constant pressure towards shorter release cycles while still maintaining a high level of quality. Agile development, continuous integration and testing are commonly used quality assurance techniques applied in industry. Increasing the level of test automation is a key ingredient to address the short release cycles. Testing at the graphical user interface (GUI) level is challenging to automate, and therefore many companies still do this manually. To help find solutions for better GUI test automation, academics are researching scriptless GUI testing to complement the script-based approach. In order to better match industrial problems with academic results, more academia-industry collaborations for case-based evaluations are needed. This paper describes such an initiative to improve, transfer and integrate an academic scriptless GUI testing tool TESTAR into the CI pipeline of a Spanish company Prodevelop. The paper describes the steps taken, the outcome, the challenges, and some lessons learned for successful industry-academia collaboration.",0
Establishing Long-lasting Relationships between Industry and Academia.,"So how can industry and academia work better together to produce graduates who not only understand the theory and practice of software engineering and process improvement, but understand the challenges, and have ideas for solutions? This paper will address these issues and serve as a basis to generate additional ideas.",0
Degree apprenticeships: Disruption or business as usual,"Historically, both the construction industry and academia have promoted engagement and collaboration to support a healthy skills supply chain and to address, together, challenges that neither can resolve alone. Such collaboration succeeds only if both parties are contributing and are fully committed to a mutual end. Differing models of collaboration have evolved in the UK and internationally but the current focus on Degree Apprenticeships in the UK has caused there to be much greater prominence of the issues around industry- academia interaction. Degree apprenticeships were part of an initiative introduced by the UK government in 2015 aimed at boosting employer investment in education and training. In April 2017, employers whose pay bill exceeded £3m had a 0.5% levy deducted, which was ring-fenced to support new apprentices. The degree apprentices were to be enrolled onto higher education programmes that were associated with standards and assessment plans designed by employer ?trailblazer? groups. The apprentices, who were at degree level, consequently studied as a part time students over a period of upto five years. The apprenticeships are completed when the end point assessment, which is undertaken by the relevant professional body, is successfully passed. This paper explores the extent of disruption this initiative has had to a UK university?s department of the built environment that piloted quantity surveying degree apprenticeships in Jan 16. Data were collected from a survey designed to investigate employer?s expectations of degree apprenticeships, their advantages and disadvantages and to ascertain the impact that the new approach might impact graduate recruitment in future. The survey findings were used to inform the strategic direction of the university?s engagement with industry and with the degree apprenticeship initiative.",0
Towards proactive management of technical debt by software metrics.,"Large software development organizations put enormous amount of effort not only for responding to continuous requests of customers but also for reengineering and refactoring activities to keep their product maintainable. Of- ten rapid and immature feature deliveries over long period of time gradually de- crease the product quality, and therefore the refactoring activities become costly and effort-intensive. This situation is described by the concept of ?technical debt?, which represents the accumulated rework that organization has to do in order to prevent the slowdown of the development. In this paper we report re- sults of a case study at Ericsson on using software metrics for moving towards proactive management of technical debt. Our observations show that there are four distinguishable maturity phases of quality management over the eight years of development time of two large products: Start-n-stop, Reactive, Systematic, and Proactive quality management. Three sophisticated metrics are applied to help the organizations to move towards Proactive management of technical debt. These metrics are used on a systematic basis to provide information on the areas of the product that have tendency of accumulating technical debt. Soft- ware engineers use this information for making decisions on whether or not the pinpointed areas should be refactored.",0
An Empirical Investigation of Transferring Research to Software Technology Innovation: A Case of Data-Driven National Security Software,"Context: Governments are providing more and more support for academia-industry collaborations for industry led research and innovation via Cooperative Research Centers (CRC). It is important to understand the processes and practices of such programs for transferring scientific R&amp;D to innovation. Goal: We aimed at empirically investigating the processes and practices implemented in the context of one of the Australian CRCs, aimed at transferring big data research to innovative software solutions for national security. Method: We applied case study method and collected and analyzed data from 17 interviews and observations of the participants of the studied CRC program. Findings: We present the innovation process implemented in the studied CRC. We particularly highlight the practices used to involve end-users in the innovation process. We further elaborate on the challenges of running this collaborative model for software technology innovation.",0
Complementary Technology Traces in Software Practice: A Retrospective Reflection over Sixteen Years of Evolution at Ericsson,"ABSTRACTTo advance knowledge about evolution of practices within a software organisation, we offer a retrospective reflection based on several years of research into a software unit at Ericsson AB. Covering 16 years of evolution, we developed multiple publications from continuously expanding sources of software technology implementation data. While these publications report from specific junctures of software practice evolution at the unit, our retrospective reflection allows us to consider the impacts of the unitâ€™s investments into two technology paradigms over the sixteen-year period: first into CMM-RUP with a focus on discipline and structured practices and years later into Agile-Lean with a focus on flexibility and responsive practices. Hence, we adopt retrospective reflection to investigate how imprints from the two paradigms, despite considerable timespan between the related technology implementations, eventually complemented each other in the unitâ€™s software practices. Because one paradigm focuses on discipline and structured practices and the other on flexibility and responsive practices, our retrospective reflections consider how the two paradigms together impacted the software unitâ€™s ambidextrous capability. As a result, we advance the idea that as software organisations over time invest in complementary technology paradigms they leave important technology traces with sustainable impacts on their software practices.",0
Generating Real-World Impact from Academic Research: Experience Report from a University Impact Hub,"This paper presents an experience report of Digital Creativity Labs (DC Labs), an 'impact hub' created at the University of York in the UK. The impact hub is dedicated to fostering impactful collaborations between practitioners and researchers in the world of games, interactive media and the rich space in which these converge. In this paper we describe how the impact hub works and the activities undertaken to build a culture of academic entrepreneurship that allows academic researchers to understand the goals of external partners and align with them. We also present some illustrative case studies before proposing initial lessons learned from experiences of the Lab. Multi-disciplinary academic teams can generate excellent impact, but this doesn't happen automatically. A culture of entrepreneurship is needed, and opportunities must be created for researchers to tackle problems jointly. Effort must be put into maintaining collaborations with partners.",0
Anti-Patterns for an Industrial PhD in the Field of ICT,"PhD programmes run by universities are planned for the needs of full-time students who have funding for the study period and an opportunity to work full time as a member of the academic community. This approach aims at following the optimal way to the goals set by the State and the university for these studies - young students, immediate continuation after MSc graduation, with membership in the university's PhD programme ensuring progress. We call these students ?administrative optimal? PhDs. However, universities also have a number of postgraduate students that work in industry. These students work full time, have significant and useful experience from practice, but have more limited resources to use for PhD-related activities. This paper reports on the challenges related to PhD students working in industry based on experiences from the field of ICT; the root cause of which is the missing support provided by the university, which focuses on ?administrative optimal? students in their PhD programmes. The paper focuses on ICT field, because it is our experience base. We believe that in ICT area it is more common to work simultaneously to studies. This fits especially in MSc studies in Finland, but the same tradition continues even in PhD level. The studies of industrial students typically need twice the time and encounter a variety of problems having their roots in the mental, practical and motivational side. We list the challenges and handle them in a structured way in the form of anti-patterns. To provide a context for our findings we have included a discussion related to general aspects of PhD studies in the paper. The aim of the paper is to open up the discussion about this important topic and report our summarised ?close to one hundred years? of experience in mentoring and supervising PhD students.",0
Lessons Learned from a Lean R\&D Project,"In a partnership between academia and industry, we report our experience in applying the Lean R&D ap- proach in the IAGO project, an oil and gas machine-learning-based dashboard. The approach is grounded in continuous experimentation through agile development, beginning with a Lean Inception workshop to define a Minimal Viable Product. Then, after technical feasibility assessments and conception phases, Scrum-based development begins, continually testing business hypotheses. We discuss our experiences in following the approach, and report developers? perceptions gathered through interviews and user evaluations of the final product. We found that the Lean Inception works well for aligning expectations and objectives among stake- holders, but it is not enough to level the domain knowledge among developers. The participation of end users in the workshop and throughout the project, as well as constant communication among all stakeholders, is very important to deliver appropriate solutions.",0
MeTeaMâ€”A method for characterizing mature software metrics teams,"Background: Metrics teams play an increasingly important role in handling data and information in modern software development organizations; they manage their companiesâ€™ measurement programs, collect and process data, and develop and distribute information products. Metrics teams can comprise several roles, and their set-up can differ between companies, as can the metrics maturity of host organizations. These differences impact the effectiveness and quality of a teamâ€™s measurement program. Objective: Our objective was to design and evaluate a model to describe the characteristics of a mature metrics team, which efficiently designs, develops, maintains, and evolves its organizationâ€™s measurement program. Method: We conducted an action research study on four metrics teams of four distinct companies. We designed and evaluated a domain-specific model for assessing the maturity of metrics teams â€“ MeTeaM â€“ and also assessed the four metrics teams per se. Results: Our results were two-fold: the creation of the metrics team maturity model MeTeaM and a template to assess metrics teams. Our evaluation showed that the model captures the characteristics of successful metrics teams and quantifies the maturity status of both the metrics teams and their host organizations. Conclusions: More mature metrics teams score higher in the MeTeaM model than less mature teams. The assessment provides less mature metrics teams with valuable insights on what factors to improve. Such insights can be shared with and acted upon successfully with their organizations.",0
Robust Machine Learning in Critical Care?Software Engineering and Medical Perspectives,"Using machine learning in clinical practice poses hard requirements on explainability, reliability, replicability and robustness of these systems. Therefore, developing reliable soft- ware for monitoring critically ill patients requires close collabo- ration between physicians and software engineers. However, these two different disciplines need to find own research perspectives in order to contribute to both the medical and the software engineering domain. In this paper, we address the problem of how to establish a collaboration where software engineering and medicine meets to design robust machine learning systems to be used in patient care. We describe how we designed software systems for monitoring patients under carotid endarterectomy, in particular focusing on the process of knowledge building in the research team. Our results show what to consider when setting up such a collaboration, how it develops over time and what kind of systems can be constructed based on it. We conclude that the main challenge is to find a good research team, where different competences are committed to a common goal.",0
Industry-Academia Collaboration: Conflicts and Strategies to Stimulate Innovation and Employability,Industry- Academia relationship is an essential element to generate innovation and employability. Systematic and coordinated approaches are absent in most industry and academy relationship which brings unsuccessful collaboration among them. Current trend of relationship between industry and academia failed to impact on revenue generation hence could not able to create employment opportunity. Identify the gaps between industry and academy will allow more outcome based research and innovation. Most research collaborations nowadays are ad hoc or opportunistic based which often failed to meet the expectation and difficult to sustain in competitive world. Successful collaboration can be established if we able to recognize potential sources of conflict and ensure that they are addressed properly. In this paper we address those gaps by presenting a systematic review of the literature on industry-academy relationship. Here we investigate on areas of conflicts; suggested strategies to overcome those and identify the driving forces that can stimulate the relation between industry and academy.,0
Ensuring the Quality of Research Objects in the Earth Science Domain,"Research objects were designed in data-intensive science under the premises of interoperability and machine-readability to describe scientific processes and findings including all the resources that were used in the research endeavour. In this poster we present our work with Earth Science communities, that have embraced the research object model for long-term preservation and reuse of knowledge, to design checklists, the main tool available to assess the quality of research objects and upon which quality metrics such completeness, stability and reliability are calculated.",0
Ensuring Sustainability of Knowledge,"Contemporary companies and organizations have understood since long the value of close cooperation between them and academia. Technology today takes huge leaps forward for every year that passes by, and ways of working evolve dramatically in order to cope with technology. Companies are no longer able to keep up with this ?insane? speed of technology and ways of working; they know more possibility to learn and adapt by themselves. The solution to this challenge is called ?action research,? an effective and efficient way for companies to keep up with what?s new and necessary for them to succeed in today?s hard competition. This book presents prerequisites needed for both parties to succeed in this type of collaboration, while this chapter focuses on a checklist to be used once such a relationship has been established.",0
It takes a Flywheel to Fly: Kickstarting and Growing the A/B testing Momentum at Scale,"Companies run A/B tests to accelerate innovation and make informed data-driven decisions. At Microsoft alone, over twenty thousand A/B tests are ran each year helping decide which features maximize user value. Not all teams and companies succeed in establishing and growing their A/B testing programs. In this paper, we explore multiple-case studies at Microsoft, Outreach, Booking.com, and empirical data collected, and share our learnings for iteratively adopting and growing A/B testing. The main contribution of this paper is the A/B Testing Flywheel. This conceptual model illustrates iteratively navigating the value- investment cycle with the goal to scale A/B testing. In every turn of the flywheel, teams need to invest in order to increase the A/B testing momentum. We describe the investments in software development processes that have been advantageous in getting the flywheel to turn. We also share example metrics that track the progress towards sustainable A/B testing momentum.",0
Um ensaio sobre o ensino de engenharia de software no Brasil e no mundo: li{\c{c}}{\~o}es para a UFOP.,"The teaching of the Software Engineering academic discipline in Computer Science graduations, in educational institutions, occurs mainly through expository and theoretical classes according to the traditional methodology of teaching. However, companies and students need a more embracing approach that results in professionals who master the skills required by the software development market, able to analyze problems, and propose and communicate solutions. In this scenario, this essay critically analyzes how teaching institutionsin Brazil and the world have been modifying their way ofteaching SoftwareEngineering by incorporating aspects of active teaching methodologies: PBL and PjBL. The purpose of this work is to base the changes made so far in the academic discipline of Software Engineering taught in DECOM / UFOP, to analyze them and, if necessary, to reconstruct them. To this end, new means were created to engage students in classrooms, making them responsible fortheir own learning. A new set of didactic materials were developed from different Learning Objects and case studies specially designed for this purpose. So, these resources were used in classrooms and teachers and students opinion?s were collected along with the academic indicators (of approval, retention, escape and locking) to evaluate the impacts of the applied changes. In this way, it is expected that the continuousimprovement of the academic discipline reflects on the formation of better professionals, overcoming the distance between the students? skills and the demands of the market",0
Pr{\'a}cticas en la gesti{\'o}n de colaboraciones cient{\'\i}ficas y tecnol{\'o}gicas universidad-industria desde las unidades de investigaci{\'o}n universitarias,"La investigación respecto a las colaboraciones científicas y tecnológicas entre universidad-industria se ha centrado en el rol de las firmas o de las universidades como institución. Sin embargo, escasa literatura ha profundizado sobre la perspectiva de las unidades de investigación universitarias. En consecuencia, este artículo tiene como objetivo recopilar las prácticas empleadas en la gestión de las alianzas tecnológicas (planeación, implementación, ejecución y evaluación) entre instituciones de educación superior y el sector productivo, identificando cuáles de ellas incluyen la perspectiva de las unidades de investigación universitaria. La metodología empleada es la Revisión Sistemática de la Literatura, tomando como fuente los resultados obtenidos de la búsqueda en la base de datos Scopus; además, se emplea el muestreo por bola de nieve y la recomendación de expertos. El análisis de contenido de alrededor de 100 estudios revisados se soportó en herramientas de minería de texto y software de análisis de datos cualitativos. Los hallazgos incluyen como prácticas de referencia para la interacción de ambos participantes: la investigación colaborativa agil, el modelo de vista 4+1 y, el establecimiento de centros físicos de investigación colaborativa (CRC), en donde investigadores de las unidades de investigación universitarias y de las firmas trabajan conjuntamente. Como prácticas recurrentes para la fase de evaluación de estas alianzas se encontró: la formulación de cuestionarios y entrevistas aplicables a diversas colaboraciones y su adaptación a ambos participantes, el estudio de caso y el cuadro de mando integral para innovación abierta, con la recomendación de adaptar estas evaluaciones a los participantes universitarios. Respecto a las fuentes de información sobre las unidades de investigación universitarias al realizar estas evaluaciones, resaltan aquellas relacionadas con los productos con protección intelectual, así como los datos consignados a través de censos y modelos nacionales de medición de los organismos de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de diferentes países.",0
Start-up ecosystems as a framework for the cooperation between start-up companies and knowledge-based institutions in Poland,"The aim of the article is to outline the picture of the Polish start-up ecosystem (in fact consisted of few ecosystems but functioning under the same scheme), i.e. its main actors and relations among them with the special focus put on the ways and ?channels? the cooperation between start-ups and knowledge-based institutions (later termed K-BI) are to be realized.",0
A COLABORA{\c{C}}{\~A}O UNIVERSIDADE-EMPRESA NO CONTEXTO DA IND{\'U}STRIA 4.0,"In the disruptive scenario of Industry 4.0, it is essential to align universities and companies as agents in the transformations of society. A considerable portion of the results of academic research does not find application, because there is a gap between the production of university research and the market needs. Thus, as a way to better understand this connection, this study aims to verify, in the scientific literature, key success factors for co-work between universities and companies in the context of industry 4.0. From the methodological point of view, this research has a descriptive purpose with a qualitative approach, making use of secondary sources through bibliographic survey, with consultation of the Scopus database. From a sample of 80 publications, different forms of interaction between universities and companies were verified, and different factors relevant to this relationship were found. It is concluded that the relations between organizations may differ under different aspects, such as purpose and location, and although the key factors are sometimes similar, given the different contextualizations of the aspects of collaboration, it is necessary to analyze the idiosyncrasies inherent to the object intended to be analyzed, being the actions especially, but not only, related to technology transfer.",0
The ABC of Software Engineering Research,"A variety of research methods and techniques are available to SE researchers, and while several overviews exist, there is consistency neither in the research methods covered nor in the terminology used. Furthermore, research is sometimes critically reviewed for characteristics inherent to the methods. We adopt a taxonomy from the social sciences, termed here the ABC framework for SE research, which offers a holistic view of eight archetypal research strategies. ABC refers to the research goal that strives for generalizability over Actors (A) and precise measurement of their Behavior (B), in a realistic Context (C). The ABC framework uses two dimensions widely considered to be key in research design: the level of obtrusiveness of the research and the generalizability of research findings. We discuss metaphors for each strategy and their inherent limitations and potential strengths. We illustrate these research strategies in two key SE domains, global software engineering and requirements engineering, and apply the framework on a sample of 75 articles. Finally, we discuss six ways in which the framework can advance SE research.",0
Difficulty Factors of Obtaining Access for Empirical Studies in Industry,"Context: The difficulty (not just effort) of obtaining access for software engineering empirical studies in industry varies greatly. Supposedly, some of this variance in difficulty is particular, stemming from properties of individual contexts (the industrial partners and their work), while the rest is repeatable, related to properties of the research question and research design. Question: What are these recurring difficulty factors that arise from research question and research design? What mechanisms produce their influence? Method: We use ideation and knowledge extraction from research experience to identify potential difficulty factors, use expert discussion to understand their mechanisms, and use concept analysis to arrange them into a taxonomy. We evaluate the result by comparatively applying it to two research efforts pursued by the same research group. Results: We find six scope factors, five problematic intervention effects factors, and seven helpful intervention (side-)effects factors. Conclusion: Considering these factors systematically during the formulation of a research question and the design of a research method can help with balancing data collection difficulty with results validity and relevance.",0
Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey,"Context: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.",0
It's a circular argument: Examining how a novel configuration impacts information flow in submarine control rooms,"The continuing advancement of technology means that sociotechnical systems are primed for revolutionary changes to ways of working that can increase capability. It is critical to consider the unintended impact technology can have on human operators particularly regarding information flow and interactions within teams. Previous research revealed that the co-location of operator's dependent on each other for task relevant information can optimise information flow previously constrained by engineering considerations. The current work compared a novel circular configuration to that of a contemporary submarine control room. In the circular configuration, consoles faced inwards, permitting eye contact between operators, and three large screen displays were introduced to provide all operators with the same information. Ten teams participated in low and high demand dived tracking scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. All communications between operators were recorded in order to generate social, information, and task networks. These were statistically compared to networks generated from a baseline study of contemporary operation. Overall, the volume of verbal communications significantly reduced, information exchange was more structured, and the volume of tasks completed by operators significantly increased when operating in an inward facing circle configuration. The current work provides support for a data driven evidence-based approach to design that is information centric but endorsed by the end user to optimise performance and increase productivity. Implications of the work and future research ideas are discussed.",0
A Marketplace for Industrial Case Studies in Software Engineering,"Case studies are valuable for both sides of the Software Engineering community, the practitioners and the researchers. To perform such research, collaboration between them is necessary. However, estab- lishing such partnerships is not straightforward. We identified a set of challenges that must be overcome and propose a research plan with the goal of creating a marketplace for industrial case studies.",0
Software startups--a research agenda,"Software startup companies develop innovative, software-intensive products within limited time frames and with few resources, searching for sustainable and scalable business models. Software startups are quite distinct from traditional mature software companies, but also from micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, introducing new challenges relevant for software engineering research. This paper?s research agenda focuses on software engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary boundaries. We believe that with this research agenda we cover a wide spectrum of the software startup industry current needs.",0
"A general theory of software engineering: Balancing human, social and organizational capitals","There exists no generally accepted theory in software engineering, and at the same time a scientific discipline needs theories. Some laws, hypotheses and conjectures exist, but yet no generally accepted theory. Several researchers and initiatives emphasize the need for theory in the discipline. The objective of this paper is to formulate a theory of software engineering. The theory is generated from empirical observations of industry practice, including several case studies and many years of experience in working closely between academia and industry. The theory captures the balancing of three different intellectual capitals: human, social and organizational capitals, respectively. The theory is formulated using a method for building theories in software engineering. It results in a theory where the relationships between the three different intellectual capitals are explored and explained. The theory is illustrated based on an industrial case study, where it is shown how decisions made in industry practice are explainable with the formulated theory, and the consequences of the decisions are made explicit. Based on the positive results, it is concluded that the theory may have a good explanatory power, although more evaluations are needed.",0
Assessing requirements engineering and software test alignmentâ€”Five case studies,"The development of large, software-intensive systems is a complex undertaking that we generally tackle by a divide and conquer strategy. Companies thereby face the challenge of coordinating individual aspects of software development, in particular between requirements engineering (RE) and software testing (ST). A lack of REST alignment can not only lead to wasted effort but also to defective software. However, before a company can improve the mechanisms of coordination they need to be understood first. With REST-bench we aim at providing an assessment tool that illustrates the coordination in software development projects and identify concrete improvement opportunities. We have developed REST-bench on the sound fundamentals of a taxonomy on REST alignment methods and validated the method in five case studies. Following the principles of technical action research, we collaborated with five companies, applying REST-bench and iteratively improving the method based on the lessons we learned. We applied REST-bench both in Agile and plan-driven environments, in projects lasting from weeks to years, and staffed as large as 1000 employees. The improvement opportunities we identified and the feedback we received indicate that the assessment was effective and efficient. Furthermore, participants confirmed that their understanding on the coordination between RE and ST improved.",0
Selecting the Right Topics for Industry-Academia Collaborations in Software Testing: An Experience Report,"The global software industry and the Software Engineering (SE) academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations (IAC) in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. Selecting the right topic for a new IAC has been reported to be challenging and often a deal-maker or-breaker for the start of IACs. Motivated by the above need, the goal of this paper is to propose experience-based guidelines from our 10+ software testing IACs in the past several years in Canada and Turkey to effectively and efficiently select right topics for IACs in software testing (also easily generalizable to other areas of SE), for the benefit of SE researchers and practitioners in starting new IACs. The experience and evidence supporting the guidelines in this paper are drawn from the authors' past projects and also seven on-going software-testing projects in the context of a large Turkish software and systems company. The topic-selection process has involved interaction with company representatives in the form of both multiple group discussions and separate face-to-face meetings while utilizing grounded-theory to find (converge to) topics which would be 'interesting' and useful from both industrial and academic perspectives. To increase the success of our topic selection process, we also utilized two other sources of information from the literature: (1) a set of four fitness criteria for topic selection in industry experiments, and (2) challenges and best practices for IAC, specific to project inception, as synthesized in a recent systematic literature review. We believe the results of this paper would be helpful for other researchers and practitioners not only in software testing but also in software engineering in general in increasing their chances of success in project inception and topic selection phase.",0
Teaching Software Product Lines: A Snapshot of Current Practices and Challenges,"Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.",0
A Study and Comparison of Industrial vs. Academic Software Product Line Research Published at SPLC,"The study presented in this paper aims to provide evidence for the hypothesis that software product line research has been changing and that the works in industry and academia have diverged over time. We analysed a subset (140) of all (593) papers published at the Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) until 2017. The subset was randomly selected to cover all years as well as types of papers. We assessed the research type of the papers (academic or industry), the kind of evaluation (application example, empirical, etc.), and the application domain. Also, we assessed which product line life-cycle phases, development practices, and topics the papers address. We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years. We also discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. We conclude that even though several topics have received more attention than others, academic and industry research on software product lines are actually rather in line with each other.",0
Empirical Research in Software Architecture: How Far have We Come?,"Context: Empirical research helps gain well-founded insights about phenomena. Furthermore, empirical research creates evidence for the validity of research results. Objective: We aim at assessing the state-of-practice of empirical research in software architecture. Method: We conducted a comprehensive survey based on the systematic mapping method. We included all full technical research papers published at major software architecture conferences between 1999 and 2015. Results: 17% of papers report empirical work. The number of empirical studies in software architecture has started to increase in 2005. Looking at the number of papers, empirical studies are about equally frequently used to a) evaluate newly proposed approaches and b) to explore and describe phenomena to better understand software architecture practice. Case studies and experiments are the most frequently used empirical methods. Almost half of empirical studies involve human participants. The majority of these studies involve professionals rather than students. Conclusions: Our findings are meant to stimulate researchers in the community to think about their expectations and standards of empirical research. Our results indicate that software architecture has become a more mature domain with regards to applying empirical research. However, we also found issues in research practices that could be improved (e.g., when describing study objectives and acknowledging limitations).",0
An impact analysis of regional industry?University interactions: The case of industrial PhD schools,"The authors discuss Triple Helix collaborations in the context of regional competitiveness. Through an exploratory case study, they identify and analyse the impact of the establishment of industrial PhD schools for participating industry and universities. The study was conducted in Sweden in 2014 and focuses on three industry?university initiatives involving a total of 57 doctoral students, 9 universities and 39 companies. The results indicate that PhD schools based on the dynamics of the Triple Helix can be of great benefit for both industry and regional universities. In addition, the paper identifies critical success factors for industry?university collaborations involving joint PhD education.",0
Effective customer relationship management at ATB financial: a case study on industry-academia collaboration in data analytics,"Data analytics serve as a means to detect trends and patterns from organizational data repositories. The variety and dynamism of data and analysis approaches create a wide range of opportunities for collaboration between academia and industry. Successful collaboration projects create win-win scenarios with tangible benefits for both sides. This paper reports about an ongoing project between ATB Financial and the Laboratory for Software Engineering Decision Support (SEDS) at The University of Calgary. The key content of the project was to leverage the benefits of data analytics for efficient and effective customer relationship management (CRM). More precisely, the objective was to find analytic solutions that allow us to predict the complexity of an opportunity and to connect it with the right team member in order to increase efficiency and create value for ATB?s customers. We report the results and lessons learned from running through the various steps of a systematic data analytics process.",0
A Critical View on PLM/ALM Convergence in Practice and Research,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the main driver for industrial smart products produced by an increasing number of manufacturers. The overall functionality of smart products is a combination of mechanical, electrical/electronic functions (hardware functions) and software functions. For hardware and software there are different lifecycle models: Product lifecycle management (PLM) focuses on hardware, application lifecycle management (ALM) focuses on software. Smart products force manufacturers to converge both lifecycle models step by step. Although seemingly important, the research community leaves this innovative area mostly up to the PLM tool vendors and the ALM tool vendors, resulting in them driving the convergence. This paper points out the mismatch between industry and academia regarding the PLM/ALM convergence. We encourage academia to increase research activities and we propose potential research topics.",0
Practical relevance of software engineering research: synthesizing the community?s voice,"Software engineering (SE) research should be relevant to industrial practice. There have been regular discussions in the SE community on this issue since the 1980?s, led by pioneers such as Robert Glass. As we recently passed the milestone of ?50 years of software engineering?, some recent positive efforts have been made in this direction, e.g., establishing ?industrial? tracks in several SE conferences. However, many researchers and practitioners believe that we, as a community, are still struggling with research relevance and utility. The goal of this paper is to synthesize the evidence and experience-based opinions shared on this topic so far in the SE community, and to encourage the community to further reflect and act on the research relevance. For this purpose, we have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review (MLR) of 54 systematically-selected sources (papers and non peer-reviewed articles). Instead of relying on and considering the individual opinions on research relevance, mentioned in each of the sources, the MLR aims to synthesize and provide the ?holistic? view on the topic. The highlights of our MLR findings are as follows. The top three root causes of low relevance, discussed in the community, are: (1) Researchers having simplistic views (or wrong assumptions) about SE in practice; (2) Lack of connection with industry; and (3) Wrong identification of research problems. The top three suggestions for improving research relevance are: (1) Using appropriate research approaches such as action-research; (2) Choosing relevant (practical) research problems; and (3) Collaborating with industry. By synthesizing all the discussions on this important topic so far, this paper aims to encourage further discussions and actions in the community to increase our collective efforts to improve the research relevance. Furthermore, we raise the need for empirically-grounded and rigorous studies on the relevance problem in SE research, as carried out in other fields such as management science.",0
How to Increase the Likelihood of Successful Transfer to Industry -- Going Beyond the Empirical,"The field of Empirical Software Engineering has undergone a much-needed expansion the last decade, and papers of all shapes and sizes are more or less mandated to have an ""empirical"" part to be published in premiere venues. The positive trend has researchers realizing the benefits, but also the investments needed, inherent to industry collaboration. That is, real practitioners, involved in the development of software intensive product, system, and service development. This paper shortly summarizes lessons learned from over ten years experience of industrial collaboration, and knowledge and technology exchange between applied researchers and industry.",0
Trends and Challenges for Software Engineering in the Mobile Domain,"Mobile computing is becoming a key aspect of our lives.

"Fontys ICT, Partners in Education Program: Intensifying Collaborations Between Higher Education and Software Industry","In this paper, we describe the existing successful practices at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences, ICT in establishing and maintaining collaboration with industry within its ICT curriculum. We describe our approach and the major challenges that we face. In particular, we provide concrete examples from one semester of the Software Engineering curriculum where different forms of collaboration are employed. Our approach, experiences and lessons learned may be valuable to other software engineering programs in involving industry partners in the education process.",0
Towards a unified catalog of attributes to guide industry in software testing technique selection,"Context: The correct selection of a software testing technique can positively influence the quality of the software in development. In previous work, a mapping study was conducted to identify approaches concerning software testing techniques selection, highlighting the attributes used to support the testing technique selection process. Objective: This paper presents a unified catalog composed of testing technique selection attributes, built from the mapping study results. The aim is to assist testing practitioners to choose the best testing techniques to apply to a particular software project. Method: Through the 10 studies that present the attributes used for supporting the process of selecting software testing techniques, 178 attributes were extracted. From this, a careful analysis was conducted to exclude the attributes that appeared duplicated. Results: According to the objective and features, the catalog of attributes was classified into 8 categories, namely (i) general testing characteristics; (ii) tools; (iii) test team; (iv) software project; (v) orthogonal defect classification (ODC) faults; (vi) web applications; (vii) concurrent software; and (viii) model-based testing. Conclusion: Through the development of this catalog, we intend to help testers, guiding them on how to select the best testing technique to be applied to software projects in the industry. It is expected that this work can foster collaboration between industry and academia to help improve the quality of software developed by choosing the best testing technique. Also, we want to further extend this work through the validation in industry real cases.",0
Misinformation Battle Revisited: Counter Strategies from Clinics to Artificial Intelligence,"The spread of misinformation is one of the severe challenges that societies have been dealing with for many years. However, the rapid growth of social media has accelerated the creation and circulation of such information and turned it into a potential threat to the main societal institutions such as peace and democracy. Although many of iconic figures, policymakers, business leaders and researchers have warned us of serious repercussions of misinformation, a clear course of action is not yet visible. To tackle such an issue, the preliminary step would be the evaluation of the as-is situation, which allows us to identify the deficiencies of existing solutions. This issue has been addressed in this study by a comprehensive analysis over decades of societal efforts against misinformation. In this analysis, quelling strategies from organisational and government perspectives are explained. Then they are investigated from efficacy level and governance mode. Our analyses show that, despite a seemingly suitable setting for confronting misinformation, there is a major shortcoming in governance mode of current quelling strategies.",0
Organized innovation: A framework for effectively managing innovation,"Organized Innovation 1  Organized Innovation: A Framework for Effectively Managing InnovationThe future of American innovation leadership is not as certain as in the past. Notably, China hasdominated in recent years (e.g., increased patent filings by 24 percent in 2012, compared to only7.8 percent in the US; World Intellectual Property Organization, 2013). One solution is toincrease understanding about the best way to manage innovation efforts. To that end, we offer atheoretical framework, Organized Innovation, which is based on our decade-long qualitative andquantitative research on National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Centers(ERCs). The framework is focused on what research leaders can do to create organizationalconditions ripe for innovation success. We organize our prescriptions into three pillars:Channeled Curiosity, Boundary-Breaking Collaboration, and Orchestrated Commercialization.We highlight five principles for achieving Channeled Curiosity: lead with vision, planstrategically, pursue technology platforms, synthesize solutions, and persist. Six principles mayhelp leaders implement Boundary-Breaking Collaboration: lead through persuasion and trust,create interdependence, promote collaboration across disciplines, connect with industry, linkuniversities, and seek active dialogue with government representatives. Finally, just as strategyimplementation is notoriously difficult and often poorly executed, commercialization can be adifficult process (Ramanujam et al., 1986). We propose six principles to help leaders betterOrchestrate Commercialization: coordinate the network, elevate role models, revisit incentives,appoint an industrial liaison officer, improve technology transfer execution, and bring inentrepreneurial and business expertise. By implementing these evidence-based managementpractices, we suggest that leaders can orient basic research toward developing ambitioustechnology platforms that can have practical application, foster collaboration spanning traditionalsilos, and facilitate a smooth commercialization process that includes all relevant players. Our Organized Innovation 2 results show building an organizational culture around these principles can have a dramaticimpact on technology transfer outputs. We also propose seven questions for future research toencourage further work in this important area.",0
"Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities for Specialized Curricula in Cyber Defense: Results from Interviews with Cyber Professionals","More specialized cybersecurity education programs are needed to address workforce needs, but it is unclear which knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) fulfil industry needs. We interviewed 48 professionals within four cyber defense specialty areas: (1) Cyber Network Defense Analysis, (2) Cyber Network Defense Infrastructure Support, (3) Incident Response, and (4) Vulnerability Assessment and Management. The professionals rated a number of specialized KSAs along two dimensions: how important the KSA was to their job and how difficult the KSA was to learn. Overall, communication and other non-technical skills were rated as being very important for all cyber defense jobs. Findings indicated that, for some specialty areas, technical knowledge and skills vary considerably between jobs and so the ability to teach oneself is more valuable than proficiency in any one KSA. Findings may be used to inform the development of general cybersecurity curricula, as well as curricula that focus on Cyber Network Defense Analysis, Cyber Network Defense Infrastructure Support, or Vulnerability Assessment and Management.",0
Collaborating to deliver value in health care: exploring conditions required for successful healthcare and life science sector collaboration,"Purpose The UK Government-funded National Health Service (NHS) is experiencing significant pressures because of the complexity of challenges to, and demands of, health-care provision. This situation has driven government policy level support for transformational change initiatives, such as value-based health care (VBHC), through closer alignment and collaboration across the health-care system-life science sector nexus. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the necessary antecedents to collaboration in VBHC through a critical exploration of the existing literature, with a view to establishing the foundations for further development of policy, practice and theory in this field. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted via searches on Scopus and Google Scholar between 2009 and 2019 for peer-reviewed articles containing keywords and phrases ?Value-based healthcare industry? and ?healthcare industry collaboration?. Refinement of the results led to the identification of ?guiding conditions? (GCs) for collaboration in VBHC. Findings Five literature-derived GCs were identified as necessary for the successful implementation of initiatives such as VBHC through system-sector collaboration. These are: a multi-disciplinarity; use of appropriate technological infrastructure; capturing meaningful metrics; understanding the total cycle-of-care; and financial flexibility. This paper outlines research opportunities to empirically test the relevance of the five GCs with regard to improving system-sector collaboration on VBHC. Originality/value This paper has developed a practical and constructive framework that has the potential to inform both policy and further theoretical development on collaboration in VBHC.",0
Making medicines: a case study in innovative academia--industry educational partnerships,"The approach to building innovative partnerships between academia and the pharmaceutical industry has expanded to investigate collaborations that offer meaningful outcomes beyond discovery and increased productivity. This case study uses a systems thinking approach to guide the process and analyse the outcome of a partnership undertaken by one pharmaceutical company and academia. The collaborative process established three tiers of evolution over a 3-year period. The outcome was an online module?based course, entitled ?Making Medicines: The Process of Drug Development?, that provides information about the drug discovery and development process. Both the course development and the final product serve as a useful case study of how collaboration between academia and industry might be achieved. The development process itself is proposed as an appropriate approach for building educational partnerships.",0
Fashion education in Sri Lanka: the nexus between formal and informal education,"For the past 15 years, the Sri Lankan apparel industry has been upgrading from apparel assembly to providing design and product development services. The country?s fashion education developed in response to the industry?s need for design professionals. The purpose of this study is to explore how fashion designer competencies are developed within Sri Lanka. This study adopts a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews conducted with 28 fashion and product development professionals, selected through purposive sampling. The development of fashion designer competencies within SL in this context are analysed and discussed. The study proposes a ?fashion education ecosystem? that has emerged from the nexus between formal fashion education and training and professional development within the industry, supporting the upgrading of the industry through the enhancement of designer skills. Sri Lanka, as a small country that depends heavily on the apparel industry for employment and economic development, provides a model for other developing countries seeking industrial upgrading from apparel assembly to design and product development services through the fashion education ecosystem.",0
Software Models for Source Code Maintainability: A Systematic Literature Review,"In this study, we collected evidence from empirical studies published over two decades-from 1995 to 2018-to answer the following general research question: ""What is the current existing empirical evidence concerning the use of software modeling to support source code maintenance?"" We carried out a systematic literature review on research published in relevant journals, as well as conference and workshop proceedings, to investigate various aspects of our general research question. Although there is a common belief that software models are beneficial for source code maintainability, this aspect has been scarcely investigated in the literature and only a few empirical studies have been conducted in an industrial context. Moreover, most of the used models are UML. As so, our study shows that there is a small body of research related to this field.",0
Establishing and implementing data collaborations for public good: A critical factor analysis to scale up the practice,"Data analytics for public good has become a hot topic thanks to the inviting opportunities to utilize ?new? sources of data, such as social media insights, call detail records, satellite imagery etc. These data are sometimes shared by the private sector as part of corporate social responsibility, especially in situations of urgency, such as in case of a natural disaster. Such partnerships can be termed as ?data collaboratives?. While experimentation grows, little is known about how such collaborations are formed and implemented. In this paper, we investigate the factors which are influential and contribute to a successful data collaborative using the Critical Success Factor (CSF) approach. As a result, we propose (1) a framework of CSFs which provides a holistic view of elements coming into play when a data collaborative is formed and (2) a list of Top 15 factors which highlights the elements which typically have a greater influence over the success of the partnership. We validated our findings in two case studies and discussed three broad factors which were found to be critical for the formation of data collaboratives: value proposition, trust, and public pressure. Our results can be used to help organizations prioritize and distribute resources accordingly when engaging in a data collaborative.",0
Solving Problems or Enabling Problem-Solving? from Purity in Empirical Software Engineering to Effective Co-production (Invited Keynote),"Studying and collaborating with any software-intensive organization demands for excellence in empirical software engineering research. The ever-growing complexity and context-dependency of software products, however, demands for more pragmatic and solution-focused research. This is a great opportunity but it also conflicts with the traditional quest for ?purity? in research and a very narrow focus of the work. In this short positioning, we elaborate on challenges which emerge from academia-industry collaborations and discuss touch upon pragmatic ways of approaching them along the co-production model which emerged from SERL Sweden.",0
Bridging the Industry-Academia Collaboration Gap a Focus towards Final Year Projects,"Industry-Academia collaboration is much necessary in order to provide benefit to this global village of technology. Indeed, there are many factors which are still needed to be considered in order to make use of computer science in IT industry. As an illustration, acceptance of the FYPs of students in IT industry and their usefulness, providing cost benefits to the students who carry out FYPs, elevating the factor of awareness of FYPs conducted/in process, in the industry, and improving liaisons of universities with industries in order to enhance the process of conducting FYPs. The focus of this research revolves around the question that ""Are the FYPs in computer science discipline beneficial for the IT industry of Pakistan, and is there any collaboration between IT industry and Academia of Pakistan?"" The results are outlined after exploring the answers to this question. For this purpose, at least 112 computer sciences graduated and post graduated personnel from different IT sectors and academia of Pakistan were surveyed using convenient sampling procedure to study the importance of their FYPs in the industry and a web based platform is suggested to bridge the gap between Industry and Academia of Pakistan. Indeed, accomplishing all of these tasks will help IT industry to get well-structured projects and students who are pre exposed to IT practices. Consequently, the linkage between industry and academia will be developed through joint and integrated research programs, offering apprenticeship to the students, industry expert opinion in curriculum designing, and appointing faculty members with sound knowledge of the industry.",0
EXTERNAL ASSESSORS?PERCEPTION TOWARDS FINAL YEAR PROJECT,"Final year project (FYP) is one of the compulsory subject for all engineering students in order to pass their undergraduate program. Normally, final year project is assessed by supervisor and examiners, which is also lecturers in the department. In the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering (DEESE), Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), FYP assessment take into account the evaluation from external assessors, namely academic from other university and representative from industry. The evaluation from these external assessors are performed on Hari Poster JKEES, where students present their final year project poster. The evaluation cover presentation delivery, project content and impact. This study analyses external assessor perspective towards impact of students? final year project to the academic, commercial or society. The assessment is based on rubric scale where 10 is the full marks. The analysis is based on scores obtained by final year students from three cohorts, namely batch 2014, 2015 and 2016. A total of 165 students, with distribution 51 students from 2014, 58 students from 2015 and 56 students from 2016. The results show that mean value for student?s score is 6.32 and 6.28 given by academic and industry panels, respectively. It shows that both external assessors from academic and industry panels agrees the students? project give a high impact to the academic, commercial or social. When compared between these two categories of assessor, only 52.12 % of the students obtained score at the same rubric scale from both assessors. Meanwhile, industry panels give 24.24% students score at lower rubric scale category compared to academic assessment. Remaining, 23.64% students obtained higher score from industry. While both external academic and industry panels agree students? project give a high impact, but they have different perspective evaluation.",0
Board 34: A Cross-Institution Collaboration: Analysis of Power Electronic Technologies for Solar Panel Arrays,"This paper presents the results of an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional collaboration between a university, a technical college, and an industrial partner in which students and professional engineers work together on a hands-on undergraduate research project investigating the effectiveness of different power electronic technologies for commercial solar panel installations. The engineering research aspect of the project aims to compare and analyze the effects of string inverts, DC optimizers, and micro-inverters on solar panel power generation under various operating conditions with the goal of optimizing both energy production and system economics. The opportunities, challenges, and expectations involved in building a collaborative working partnership between the technical college, university, and local industry are presented. Furthermore, methods for creating a successful working relationship between undergraduate students bridging two different disciplines (clean energy and electrical engineering) are discussed. The motivation for this project stems from the pervasive expansion of renewable energy resources and development of new and innovative technologies allowing for increased efficiency, decreased development costs, improved reliability and overall system simplification. When installing solar panel systems, it is essential to determine the optimal inverter topology so that maximum power can be extracted. Outside of the solar panels themselves, the inverters are the most important constituent of the solar power system as they take the DC electrical power that the solar panels produce and converts it into AC power before injecting it onto the grid. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of solar panel arrays fitted with string inverters, DC power optimizers, and micro-inverters. Together students from both institutions spent twelve months studying, installing, and analyzing the various inverter technologies. The result of this work is mutually beneficial to all parties involved. The university students gain practical, hands-on experience setting up and installing solar panels in the field while the students from the technical college benefit through learning about the theory behind the operation of the power electronic circuits. The faculty develop working relationships with industry experts and visa versa. This partnership advances academic and technical knowledge of all participants. The data gathered from this study is an immense asset for the engineers from industry as it helps them improve solar panel design and better understand customer needs. This hands-on field experience not only stimulate students? interest in learning both electronics and clean energy, but also help them recognize the importance and utility of interdisciplinary work. Moreover, the team-oriented nature of this project will foster students? development of essential skills in team-work, communication, and time-management, serving them well into their professional careers.",0
University-industry collaboration: A new way of educating future generations of engineers in India,"India, constitutes the world's third largest education system (after the US and China), but we still continue to struggle with many collective problems such as job placements, student retirement, learning impairments, language barriers and cultural differences. Cooperation between the industry and the scientific community if done with proper design and management can turn out to be beneficial for both industry partners and academic institutions. Such a cooperation can be achieved on micro and macro levels and can provide an inclusion of various educational institutions and industry partners. The collaboration may have different goals catering to the needs of industry partners and academic institutions. The involvement of industry and academia may not only be restricted to course curriculum but also result in joint research efforts and programs, which aims to connect students and industry professionals. This paper is an attempt to explore the relationship between academic and industry cooperation in order to enhance the skill set of a student along with his or hers employability opportunities. We discuss how capital investment and technology transfer can result in better development of the society and result in creation of new products, services and employment opportunities. The paper would be listing down some of the initiatives taken by the Indian government for creating an ecosystem for university-industry collaboration. Apart from this, we list some of the prominent university-industry collaborations that have taken place in the field of computer science engineering. Finally, we discuss some key initiatives which if taken into consideration could enhance the prospects of a fruitful university-industry collaboration and can benefit to the society in large.",0

Technology transfer - Requirements Engineering research to industrial practice an open (ended) debate,"Technology and knowledge have been recognized as main sources of competitive advantage of corporations, industries and nations, particularly in the software domain. They have led to the creation of local ecosystems devoted to development and transfer activities, which ensure not only personal and institutional motivation/recognition, but also social and economic gains. An open (ended) debate panel is proposed in order to develop greater awareness and seek deeper understanding of such activities from Requirements Engineering research to industrial practice. The panel involves researchers and practitioners with the perspective of eliciting: (i) experiences in knowledge and technology development and transfer; (ii) awareness and effectiveness of models and patterns; and (iii) factors for having successful collaboration between research institutions and industry. The organizers also plan to run a survey during and after the conference, summarizing their conclusions in specific post-conference reports.",0
Bridging the Gap: Voices from Industry and Research on Industrial Relevance of SPLC,"Product line engineering emerged from a fruitful interaction of applied research in academia, industry research, and software engineering practice. SPLC was created as the primary venue to exchange ideas on this emerging topic and integrate the communities. Yet, today, SPLC is mostly regarded as an academic conference with little industry participation. Since a strong integration of academia and industry is often seen positive, here, we try to better understand motivations for practitioners to visit academic conferences like SPLC and the impact this has on such conferences. This analysis is based on nine systematic interviews with practitioners and researchers, who have been members of the SPLC community and other leading software engineering communities for a long time. Our preliminary results clarify the relevance and interest of practitioners and researchers to exchange knowledge and learn when attending scientific software engineering conferences such as SPLC. Yet, the results also highlight the differences between the goals of industry and academic conference participants, which often lead to inefficiencies and even barriers for constructive interaction at scientific conferences such as SPLC. We use this as a basis for pointing out further discussion points, both from the perspective of the interviewees as well as the authors.",0

Finally, the shortcomings found in our existing practices and possibilities for improving our prototype development processes and practices are discussed.",0
Industrial Collaboration in Vocational College: A Preliminary Study,"In recent years, the collaboration between educational institutions and industry has been given much attention particularly in the field of technical and vocational education and training (TVET). Collaborations between educational institutions and industrial organizations to propel strategic partnership are necessity. The inter-organizational collaborations are important to ensure the graduates fulfill the requirements of the industry and the national economy prior to entering the job market. The need to study this topic was initiated by observing the growing challenges towards the role played by vocational colleges as one of the newly established TVET educational institutions in preparing their graduates with relevant skills. The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the possibilities and limitations of collaboration between industrial companies and vocational colleges. An inductive qualitative approach was deployed in the research process. The respondents were administrators and lecturers from three vocational colleges. Interviews were conducted to identify the level of collaboration of the vocational colleges with companies and the limitations for such collaboration. Initial findings indicated that vocational colleges need to collaborate with industry and workplace for practical hands on that can be done by implementing the On-the-Job Training (OJT) and National Dual Training System (NDTS). However, process of getting approval for Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was the barrier specified by these three Vocational colleges.",0
Traceability Information Model for Very Small Entities with ISO/IEC 29110,"Requirements traceability is an important quality factor in the life cycle of the software, there is a lot of software standards that demands his implementation, for example, ISO/IEC 29110, a standard for very small entities; however, projects of small organizations do not perform an adequate application of traceability. In the literature there are proposals with a high level of abstraction; the realization of a traceability information model for small software development organizations provides a narrow alternative, reducing the gap between the theory and the reality in software development. We present a traceability information model for small organizations within the framework of ISO/IEC 29110, in this way organizations access an illustrative and reusable traceability solution that allows them to improve the quality of software development. The article contemplates the definition of the models.",0
A Study on the Effect of'University administration's efforts' and'Trust of IU'on'Industry-University Barrier',"In this study, we identify the obstacles that occur through the relationship between I-U cooperation and look for factors that can overcome them in the 'university administration's efforts' and 'Trust between I-U'. In the study of existing I-U cooperation, the relationship between industry and university has accumulated experiences and various channels of bilateral cooperation by sustaining interactions and absorbing capacity of knowledge by path dependence. However, as cooperation increases, 'I-U cooperation barrier' are inevitable, which is explained by two perspectives: 'Difference in mutual recognition' and 'Institutional barriers'. In order to induce the achievement of effective I-U cooperation, it is necessary to overcome these obstacles stemming from mutual relations, and it will be possible to maintain the relationship of continuous I-U cooperation. The researchers conducted research on companies participating in the I-U cooperation technology development project of the 'Ministry of Small and Medium Venture Business', which is a representative I-U cooperation program in Korea. This project will be promoted in the 'Small & Medium Business I-U cooperation Center', an administration-dedicated organization of the university. The researchers measure 'University administration's efforts' and 'Trust between I-U'to overcome'I-U cooperation barrier' In order to clarify the data of the research sample, a questionnaire survey of organizational units was conducted for all companies participating in the 'I-U cooperation technology development projects' of the SMEs and Startups between 2011 and 2015, and the responses of 356 organizations were drawn. The results showed that the higher the level of 'University administration's efforts' and Trust between I-U', the lower 'Difference in mutual recognition' and 'Institutional barriers'. Particularly, it showed higher explanatory power to overcome 'Institutional barriers' among obstacles. Therefore, it should be accompanied by the interest, implementation and institutional support of I-U-R subjects to raise the level of these two factors that can overcome 'I-U cooperation barrier'.",0
From Research Topic to Industrial Practice: An Experience Report,"Continuous technological progress requires both research and industry to work together. It is a necessity which cannot and should not be avoided. However, due to different interests of the two, it is often accompanied by various challenges. The inability to foresee and overcome the challenges can greatly impact the quality of collaboration results and thus chances of such results being used further by the industry. In this paper, we provide background on the topic and emphasize frequently discussed points. Focus of the work are industry-academia collaborations in applied computer science research such as visualization. For that purpose, a set of requirements is recognized and provided for both industry and research community. Further, we provide an overview of challenges recognized over years of experience from working in industry-academia collaborations. Together, the challenges indicate the gap between the industry and research which is inherently transferred further onto results of collaborative research. Finally, we discuss various possibilities for both industry and research to reduce the gap.",0
Academia-Industry Linkages: Nurturing the Entrepreneurial Graduates--A Case Study at University Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM),"The increasing rate of unemployed graduates is one of the critical issues that triggers world's concerns lately. Malaysia?s recent upsurge in graduate unemployment has specific causes relating to economic development, education policy-making, and reforms in the economy as well as in higher education. In Malaysia, every year, almost 200,000 fresh graduates search for employment. Besides academic performance, it has been acknowledged that graduates should be equipped with industrial relevance skills to increase their marketability and competency rate. The Government of Malaysia also encourage active involvement of industries through strategic partnerships and joint ventures with higher education institutions in providing these relevant skills and training to the students. The purpose of this paper is to expose one of the programs called Hands-On Programme of Entrepreneurship (HOPE) which being executed through the academia-industry linkages experienced by University Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) in nurturing the entrepreneurial graduates. This paper adopts a case study of HOPE at USIM and found that the involvement of industry is pivotal in tertiary?s education, especially in terms of students? activities and development. Ultimately, this paper provides a new insight on the academia- industry linkages especially for nurturing students to have entrepreneurial attributes as one of soft-skills upon their graduation.",0
Academic and Industry Collaboration: A Literature Review,"As part of a larger project determining best practices for establishing and maintaining effective, sustainable, collaborative relationships between academic and industry professionals, this review will outline the available materials and, conversely, the multiple gaps that exist regarding course content, methods of teaching, and practical experience relating to preparation for careers in engineering and engineering technology. Currently, there is no clear agreement on which principles and practices best enable industrial partners and academic institutions to establish and maintain mutually-beneficial partnerships. In fact, there is no clear definition in the literature of what a mutually-beneficial partnership entails, across the full range of educational, research, and professional development and service activities carried out within the engineering and technical community. The authors of this paper established informally that educators in both engineering and engineering technology are often challenged by this lack of research on sound recommendations regarding collaborative efforts. This paper is intended to be the start of a larger systemic literature review.",0
Changing Museums Through Cooperation and Collaboration,"Working within a new museological paradigm that sees museums as fluid, unbounded, and dependent upon context, this article seeks to examine the discourses that underpin collaboration as a contemporary and necessary museum education practice. In conducting this examination we will use examples from both Germany and the United States to illustrate the fact that though the two nations exist thousands of miles apart, and the museums within each nation are situated in different socio-political and cultural contexts, the underlying purpose of collaboration is the same in each nation and its museums. Collaboration seeks to change the museum from, in the immortal words of Stephen Weil, being about something to being for somebody.",0
Critical success factors in university-industry collaboration: a bibliometric analysis,"Considering the technological development, and particularly the global pandemic of COVID-19, it is essential to align universities and companies as agents in the transformation of society. However, a portion of academic research results does not find application in the productive sector. To better understand such (dis)connection, this study aims to verify in the scientific literature the critical success factors proper to the collaboration between universities and companies. Therefore, a bibliographic survey was carried out in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, considering the period 2000-2020 as temporality. From a quantitative point of view, a bibliometric analysis is presented regarding the year of publication, origin, thematic categories, authorship and co-citation networks, and with a qualitative character, through content analysis, critical factors were identified, with emphasis on trust, commitment, assumption of risks, realistic and well-defined objectives, managerial engagement of project coordinators, university reputation, previous experience in collaboration, communication and organizational culture.",0
Critical success factors (CSFs) in university-industry collaboration (UIC) projects in research universities,"This research study examines the CSFs in UIC to ensure the success of any collaboration. Thirteen success factors were evaluated by respondents from industry and public research universities in order to identify the most critical ones. Adopting a quantitative research strategy, both groups of respondents were selected based on their experience of involvement in UIC projects. Similarities and differences in the two university and industry perspectives were identified. Universities focused more on the quality of the researcher, commitment and financial support as the main factors in ensuring the success of the collaboration. As regards their industrial counterparts, some similar factors to the universities were highlighted. In addition, the industrial partners were concerned with constant communication and strong teamwork as the main ingredients of successful implementation of UIC projects. By understanding the similarities and the differences, a positive environment can be created and thus both parties will prioritize the relevant factors when conducting collaborative activities.",0
Software Development in Startup Companies: The Greenfield Startup Model,"Software startups are newly created companies with no operating history and oriented towards producing cutting-edge products. However, despite the increasing importance of startups in the economy, few scientific studies attempt to address software engineering issues, especially for early-stage startups. If anything, startups need engineering practices of the same level or better than those of larger companies, as their time and resources are more scarce, and one failed project can put them out of business. In this study we aim to improve understanding of the software development strategies employed by startups. We performed this state-of-practice investigation using a grounded theory approach. We packaged the results in the Greenfield Startup Model (GSM), which explains the priority of startups to release the product as quickly as possible. This strategy allows startups to verify product and market fit, and to adjust the product trajectory according to early collected user feedback. The need to shorten time-to-market, by speeding up the development through low-precision engineering activities, is counterbalanced by the need to restructure the product before targeting further growth. The resulting implications of the GSM outline challenges and gaps, pointing out opportunities for future research to develop and validate engineering practices in the startup context.",0
Empirical software engineering experts on the use of students and professionals in experiments,"[Context] Controlled experiments are an important empirical method to generate and validate theories. Many software engineering experiments are conducted with students. It is often claimed that the use of students as participants in experiments comes at the cost of low external validity while using professionals does not. [Objective] We believe a deeper understanding is needed on the external validity of software engineering experiments conducted with students or with professionals. We aim to gain insight about the pros and cons of using students and professionals in experiments. [Method] We performed an unconventional, focus group approach and a follow-up survey. First, during a session at ISERN 2014, 65 empirical researchers, including the seven authors, argued and discussed the use of students in experiments with an open mind. Afterwards, we revisited the topic and elicited experts? opinions to foster discussions. Then we derived 14 statements and asked the ISERN attendees excluding the authors, to provide their level of agreement with the statements. Finally, we analyzed the researchers? opinions and used the findings to further discuss the statements. [Results] Our survey results showed that, in general, the respondents disagreed with us about the drawbacks of professionals. We, on the contrary, strongly believe that no population (students, professionals, or others) can be deemed better than another in absolute terms. [Conclusion] Using students as participants remains a valid simplification of reality needed in laboratory contexts. It is an effective way to advance software engineering theories and technologies but, like any other aspect of study settings, should be carefully considered during the design, execution, interpretation, and reporting of an experiment. The key is to understand which developer population portion is being represented by the participants in an experiment. Thus, a proposal for describing experimental participants is put forward.",0
Software test process improvement approaches: A systematic literature review and an industrial case study,"Software test process improvement (STPI) approaches are frameworks that guide software development organizations to improve their software testing process. We have identified existing STPI approaches and their characteristics (such as completeness of development, availability of information and assessment instruments, and domain limitations of the approaches) using a systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, two selected approaches (TPI NEXT and TMMi) are evaluated with respect to their content and assessment results in industry. As a result of this study, we have identified 18 STPI approaches and their characteristics. A detailed comparison of the content of TPI NEXT and TMMi is done. We found that many of the STPI approaches do not provide sufficient information or the approaches do not include assessment instruments. This makes it difficult to apply many approaches in industry. Greater similarities were found between TPI NEXT and TMMi and fewer differences. We conclude that numerous STPI approaches are available but not all are generally applicable for industry. One major difference between available approaches is their model representation. Even though the applied approaches generally show strong similarities, differences in the assessment results arise due to their different model representations.",0
Supporting Change Impact Analysis Using a Recommendation System: An Industrial Case Study in a Safety-Critical Context,"Change Impact Analysis (CIA) during software evolution of safety-critical systems is a labor-intensive task. Several authors have proposed tool support for CIA, but very few tools were evaluated in industry. We present a case study on ImpRec, a recommendation System for Software Engineering (RSSE), tailored for CIA at a process automation company. ImpRec builds on assisted tracing, using information retrieval solutions and mining software repositories to recommend development artifacts, potentially impacted when resolving incoming issue reports. In contrast to the majority of tools for automated CIA, ImpRec explicitly targets development artifacts that are not source code. We evaluate ImpRec in a two-phase study. First, we measure the correctness of ImpRec's recommendations by a simulation based on 12 years' worth of issue reports in the company. Second, we assess the utility of working with ImpRec by deploying the RSSE in two development teams on different continents. The results suggest that ImpRec presents about 40 percent of the true impact among the top-10 recommendations. Furthermore, user log analysis indicates that ImpRec can support CIA in industry, and developers acknowledge the value of ImpRec in interviews. In conclusion, our findings show the potential of reusing traceability associated with developers' past activities in an RSSE.",0
Motivating the contributions: An Open Innovation perspective on what to share as Open Source Software,"Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firmâ€™s practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems.",0
Detecting requirements defects with NLP patterns: an industrial experience in the railway domain,"In the railway safety-critical domain requirements documents have to abide to strict quality criteria. Rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been developed to automatically identify quality defects in natural language requirements. However, the literature is lacking empirical studies on the application of these techniques in industrial settings. Our goal is to investigate to which extent NLP can be practically applied to detect defects in the requirements documents of a railway signalling manufacturer. To address this goal, we first identified a set of typical defects classes, and, for each class, an engineer of the company implemented a set of defect-detection patterns by means of the GATE tool for text processing. After a preliminary analysis, we applied the patterns to a large set of 1866 requirements previously annotated for defects. The output of the patterns was further inspected by two domain experts to check the false positive cases. Additional discard-patterns were defined to automatically remove these cases. Finally, SREE, a tool that searches for typically ambiguous terms, was applied to the requirements. The experiments show that SREE and our patterns may play complementary roles in the detection of requirements defects. This is one of the first works in which defect detection NLP techniques are applied on a very large set of industrial requirements annotated by domain experts. We contribute with a comparison between traditional manual techniques used in industry for requirements analysis, and analysis performed with NLP. Our experience shows that several discrepancies can be observed between the two approaches. The analysis of the discrepancies offers hints to improve the capabilities of NLP techniques with company specific solutions, and suggests that also company practices need to be modified to effectively exploit NLP tools.",0
Technology transfer models and elements in the university-industry collaboration,"Over the years, universities have been considered as research centers that seek to collaborate with industries to create innovative products. This link has generated many concepts, among them being the concept of technology transfer. The objective of this work is to present a systematic review on the technology transfer generated in university-industry collaboration (UIC). Based on a review of 66 papers, the results presented in this article include the technology transfer (TT) models presented in the literature, a description of the common elements in a transfer process, and a description of the interaction between the elements involved, through the presentation of a conceptual model of technology transfer in the context of collaboration between the university and the industry.",0
The contextual nature of innovation â€“ An empirical investigation of three software intensive products,"Context New products create significant opportunities for differentiation and competitive advantage. To increase the chances of new product success, a universal set of critical activities and determinants have been recommended. Some researchers believe, however, that these factors are not universal, but are contextual. Objective This paper reports innovation processes followed to develop three software intensive products for understanding how and why innovation practice is dependent on innovation context. Method This paper reports innovation processes and practices with an in-depth multi-case study of three software product innovations from Ericsson, IBM, and Rorotika. It describes the actual innovation processes followed in the three cases and discusses the observed innovation practice and relates it to state-of-the-art. Results The cases point to a set of contextual factors that influence the choice of innovation activities and determinants for developing successful product innovations. The cases provide evidence that innovation practice cannot be standardized, but is contextual in nature. Conclusion The rich description of the interaction between context and innovation practice enables future investigations into contextual elements that influence innovation practice, and calls for the creation of frameworks enabling activity and determinant selection for a given context â€“ since one size does not fit all.",0
Requirements communication and balancing in large-scale software-intensive product development,"Context Several industries developing products on a large-scale are facing major challenges as their products are becoming more and more software-intensive. Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight RE framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.",0
Workshop videos for requirements communication,"Shared understanding of requirements between stakeholders and the development team is a critical success factor for requirements engineering. Workshops are an effective means for achieving such shared understanding. Stakeholders and team representatives can meet and discuss what a planned software system should be and how it should support achieving stakeholder goals. However, some important intended recipients of the requirements are often not present in such workshops: the developers. Thus, they cannot benefit from the in-depth understanding of the requirements and of the rationales for these requirements that develops during the workshops. The simple handover of a requirements specification hardly compensates the rich requirements understanding that is needed for the development of an acceptable system. To compensate the lack of presence in a requirements workshop, we propose to record that requirements workshop on video. If workshop participants agree to be recorded, a video is relatively simple to create and can capture much more aspects about requirements and rationales than a specification document. This paper presents the workshop video technique and a phenomenological evaluation of its use for requirements communication from the perspective of software developers. The results show how the technique was appreciated by observers of the video, present positive and negative feedbacks from the observers, and lead to recommendations for implementing the technique in practice.",0
Experience-Based Guidelines for Effective and Efficient Data Extraction in Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering,"To systematically collect evidence and to structure a given area in software engineering (SE), Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) and Systematic Mapping (SM) studies have become common. Data extraction is one of the main phases (activities) when conducting an SM or an SLR, whose objective is to extract required data from the primary studies and to accurately record the information researchers need to answer the questions of the SM/SLR study. Based on experience in a large number of SM/SLR studies, we and many other researchers have found the data extraction in SLRs to be time consuming and error-prone, thus raising the real need for heuristics and guidelines for effective and efficient data extraction in these studies, especially to be learnt by junior and young researchers. As a 'guideline' paper, this paper contributes a synthesized list of challenges usually faced during SLRs' data extraction phase and the corresponding solutions (guidelines). For our synthesis, we consider two data sources: (1) the pool of 16 SLR studies in which the authors have been involved in, as well as (2) a review of challenges and guidelines in the existing literature. Our experience in utilizing the presented guidelines in the near past have helped our junior colleagues to conduct data extractions more effectively and efficiently.",0
Developing and using checklists to improve software effort estimation: A multi-case study,"Expert judgment based effort estimation techniques are widely used for estimating software effort. In the absence of process support, experts may overlook important factors during estimation, leading to inconsistent estimates. This might cause underestimation, which is a common problem in software projects. This multi-case study aims to improve expert estimation of software development effort. Our goal is two-fold: 1) to propose a process to develop and evolve estimation checklists for agile teams, and 2) to evaluate the usefulness of the checklists in improving expert estimation processes. The use of checklists improved the accuracy of the estimates in two case companies. In particular, the underestimation bias was reduced to a large extent. For the third case, we could not perform a similar analysis, due to the unavailability of historical data. However, when checklist was used in two sprints, the estimates were quite accurate (median Balanced Relative Error (BRE) bias of -0.05). The study participants from the case companies observed several benefits of using the checklists during estimation, such as increased confidence in estimates, improved consistency due to help in recalling relevant factors, more objectivity in the process, improved understanding of the tasks being estimated, and reduced chances of missing tasks.",0
"A Two-Component Language for Adaptation: Design, Semantics and Program Analysis","Adaptive systems are designed to modify their behaviour in response to changes of their operational environment. We propose a two-component language for adaptive programming, within the Context-Oriented Programming paradigm. It has a declarative constituent for programming the context and a functional one for computing. We equip our language with a dynamic formal semantics. Since wrong adaptation could severely compromise the correct behaviour of applications and violate their properties, we also introduce a two-phase verification mechanism. It is based on a type and effect system that type-checks programs and computes, as an effect, a sound approximation of their behaviour. The effect is exploited at load time to mechanically verify that programs correctly adapt themselves to all possible running environments.",0
iDispenser ? Big Data Enabled Intelligent Dispenser,"With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], ?Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger?s risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions.?The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by ?Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens?[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It?s known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.? Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places.In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting. The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.",0
Large-scale information retrieval in software engineering-an experience report from industrial application,"Software Engineering activities are information intensive. Research proposes Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to support engineers in their daily tasks, such as establishing and maintaining traceability links, fault identification, and software maintenance. We describe an engineering task, test case selection, and illustrate our problem analysis and solution discovery process. The objective of the study is to gain an understanding of to what extent IR techniques (one potential solution) can be applied to test case selection and provide decision support in a large-scale, industrial setting. We analyze, in the context of the studied company, how test case selection is performed and design a series of experiments evaluating the performance of different IR techniques. Each experiment provides lessons learned from implementation, execution, and results, feeding to its successor. The three experiments led to the following observations: 1) there is a lack of research on scalable parameter optimization of IR techniques for software engineering problems; 2) scaling IR techniques to industry data is challenging, in particular for latent semantic analysis; 3) the IR context poses constraints on the empirical evaluation of IR techniques, requiring more research on developing valid statistical approaches. We believe that our experiences in conducting a series of IR experiments with industry grade data are valuable for peer researchers so that they can avoid the pitfalls that we have encountered. Furthermore, we identified challenges that need to be addressed in order to bridge the gap between laboratory IR experiments and real applications of IR in the industry.",0
An approach to align business and IT perspectives during the SOA services identification,"Service-oriented architectures are a widely used business practice to develop enterprise information systems. However, the current analysis and design methods consider the software engineering perspective only, what is not sufficient for a proper alignment between business and IT, resulting in demand for new approaches offering the business perspective as well. Such new approaches are required crucial to identify software services that are aligned to the business values, hence contributing to customer satisfaction. This paper describes an approach that focuses on business value modeling and uses model-driven techniques to generate the input required by current software service identification methods, thus aligning business and software perspectives. This approach was evaluated in two parts. First, a quasi-experiment evaluates the perceived efficacy of the business perspective, and a proof-of-concept tool was built to check the feasibility of generating typical inputs needed by software service identification methods. The results show a promising approach for the alignment of business and IT perspectives.",0
Development of framework for an integrated model for technology transfer,"Background/Objectives: Existing models of Technology Transfer have limited horizon and are either Qualitative or Quantitative in nature. A model framework is developed which is structured, linked with organizational goal, incorporates both concepts and has a wider scope. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The research methodology used in this study is a combination of literature review and key informant interviews. The literature review includes both published as well as unpublished sources of literature. In case of key informant interviews, informal telephonic discussions have been carried out with the key executives of the organizations (industry, university, research institutions and government officials) who are actively engaged in technology identification, technology sourcing and technology transfer. Findings: It is evident from the study that initial technology transfer started with the passive role of transferee and gradually they started taking the leading role in the whole technology transfer process. At the beginning, technology transfer concept was almost limited to search and transfer, gradually it started focusing on transfer plan and implementation of technology transfer and in most recent time, focus is on effectiveness of technology transfer and creating spirit of innovation. But again each one of the existing models has a limited horizon and applicability. These existing models are too specific in nature whereas the practicing managers are in need of a comprehensive integrated model. The analysis of the limitations of the existing models has proved the necessity for development of an integrated model which is structured, aims to fulfill the aspiration of the organization, closely links with organizational goal and objectives, considers the barriers and issues in technology transfer process and takes care of both Qualitative and Quantitative parameters of technology transfer. Applications/Improvements: This proposed integrated model will help the practicing managers to take proactive approach and control of forthcoming issues of technology transfer, monitor the progress as well and create spirit of innovation",0
Comparing Value-Driven Methods: an Experiment Design.,"A business model is a representation of an organization with a particular point of view. It is common to find different types of models to describe the business. However, methods to create business models representing an economic point of view have only emerged over the last few years in the scientific community. Such methods aid business specialists improving the economics understanding of the business, helping both defining more efficient business strategies and better aligning the information technology systems with the business. This paper aims at describing the design of an experiment to compare two methods to specify economic values (e3value and value-driven development). Our experiment design allows predicting the acceptance of a particular method in practice, based on the effort of applying the method, the quality of the artifacts produced, and the user perceptions with regard to the quality of the method.",0
Technology transfer models: typology and a generic model,"The technology transfer (TT) process has been adopted by companies throughout the world. For many companies and countries, the implementation of TT process is determinant to the economic growth and a way to keep updated with technology development and innovation. Ever since TT started to be discussed in the literature, several different models of TT have been proposed with the purpose of making the TT process easier and more successful. The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic model that can be adapted to any organisation and institution interested in transferring knowledge and technology. To reach this purpose, a systematic review on technology transfer models was done using the methodology for systematic review, Methodi Ordinatio, using data from 1990 to 2015. Due to the great variety of models identified in the systematic review, and for better understanding those models and their purposes, a typology is also presented.",0
Representing software project vision by means of video: A quality model for vision videos,"Establishing a shared software project vision is a key challenge in Requirements Engineering (RE). Several approaches use videos to represent visions. However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) a hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality characteristics and (b) a mapping of these characteristics to the video production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15 characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived by the subjects from a developerâ€™s the point of view. Six characteristics (video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability) correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is a sound basis for future refinements and extensions.",0
Harnessing Automated Test Case Generators for GUI Testing in Industry,"Modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are highly dynamic and support multi-touch interactions and screen gestures besides conventional inputs via mouse and keyboard. Hence, the flexibility of modern GUIs enables countless usage scenarios and combinations including all kind of interactions. From the viewpoint of testing, this flexibility results in a combinatorial explosion of possible interaction sequences. It dramatically raises the required time and effort involved in GUI testing, which brings manual exploration as well as conventional regression testing approaches to its limits. Automated test generation (ATG) has been proposed as a solution to reduce the effort for manually designing test cases and to speed-up test execution cycles. In this paper we describe how we successfully harnessed a state-of-the-art ATG tool (Randoop) developed for code-based API testing to generate GUI test cases. The key is an adapter that transforms API calls to GUI events. The approach is the result of a research transfer project with the goal to apply ATG for testing of human machine interfaces used to control industrial machinery. In this project the ATG tool was used to generate unit test cases for custom GUI controls and system tests for exploring navigation scenarios. It helped to increase the test coverage and was able reveal new defects in the implementation of the GUI controls as well as in the GUI application.",0
Similarity-based prioritization of test case automation,"The importance of efficient software testing procedures is driven by an ever increasing system complexity as well as global competition. In the particular case of manual test cases at the system integration level, where thousands of test cases may be executed before release, time must be well spent in order to test the system as completely and as efficiently as possible. Automating a subset of the manual test cases, i.e, translating the manual instructions to automatically executable code, is one way of decreasing the test effort. It is further common that test cases exhibit similarities, which can be exploited through reuse when automating a test suite. In this paper, we investigate the potential for reducing test effort by ordering the test cases before such automation, given that we can reuse already automated parts of test cases. In our analysis, we investigate several approaches for prioritization in a case study at a large Swedish vehicular manufacturer. The study analyzes the effects with respect to test effort, on four projects with a total of 3919 integration test cases constituting 35,180 test steps, written in natural language. The results show that for the four projects considered, the difference in expected manual effort between the best and the worst order found is on average 12 percentage points. The results also show that our proposed prioritization method is nearly as good as more resource demanding meta-heuristic approaches at a fraction of the computational time. Based on our results, we conclude that the order of automation is important when the set of test cases contain similar steps (instructions) that cannot be removed, but are possible to reuse. More precisely, the order is important with respect to how quickly the manual test execution effort decreases for a set of test cases that are being automated.",0
Improving Continuous Integration with Similarity-Based Test Case Selection,"Automated testing is an essential component of Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD), such as scheduling automated test sessions on overnight builds. That allows stakeholders to execute entire test suites and achieve exhaustive test coverage, since running all tests is often infeasible during work hours, i.e., in parallel to development activities. On the other hand, developers also need test feedback from CI servers when pushing changes, even if not all test cases are executed. In this paper we evaluate similarity-based test case selection (SBTCS) on integration-level tests executed on continuous integration pipelines of two companies. We select test cases that maximise diversity of test coverage and reduce feedback time to developers. Our results confirm existing evidence that SBTCS is a strong candidate for test optimisation, by reducing feedback time (up to 92% faster in our case studies) while achieving full test coverage using only information from test artefacts themselves.",0
Key factors in university-to-university knowledge and technology transfer on international student mobility,"The international circulation of scientists from developing to developed countries can be one of the ways to access advanced knowledge. Similarly, another alternative proposed in this paper is the international student mobility as a way to increase the tacit knowledge asset of a country. Based on this assumption, the purpose of this paper is to approach knowledge and technology transfer having two universities as subjects of study in order to identify the barriers and mechanisms in the transfer within the international student mobility scenario. The paper investigates two groups of students, one from Brazil and another from France, which participated in an international student mobility programme for a period longer than six months. Results show the main barriers and the most effective mechanisms for this category of knowledge and technology transfer. At the end of the paper, we propose a model which has as interfaces two universities as transferor and transferee.",0
Is Effectiveness Sufficient to Choose an Intervention? Considering Resource Use in Empirical Software Engineering,"Context: Software Engineering (SE) research with a scientific foundation aims to influence SE practice to enable and sustain efficient delivery of high quality software. Goal: To improve the impact of SE research, one objective is to facilitate practitioners in choosing empirically vetted interventions. Method: Literature from evidence-based medicine, economic evaluations in SE and software economics is reviewed. Results: In empirical SE research, the emphasis has been on substantiating the claims about the benefits of proposed interventions. However, to support informed decision making by practitioners regarding technology adoption, we must present a business case for these interventions, which should comprise not just effectiveness, but also the evidence of cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: This paper highlights the need to investigate and report the resources required to adopt an intervention. It also provides some guidelines and examples to improve support for practitioners in decisions regarding technology adoption.",0
Requirements Engineering for Safety-Critical Systems: An Interview Study with Industry Practitioners,"We have conducted in-depth interviews with experienced practitioners in the Safety-Critical Systems (SCS) domain in order to investigate several aspects related to requirements specification and safety analysis for SCS. We interviewed 19 practitioners from eleven SCS companies in different domains with the intention of verifying which approaches they use day-to-day, and what their perceptions are in relation to the approaches used to elicit, analyze, specify and validate safety requirements. The aim of this study is to obtain an in-depth understanding of how requirements engineering is carried out in companies that develop SCS.",0
Requirements Traceability Technologies Selection for Industry,"The ultimate goal for researchers to develop a requirements traceability (RT) technology is transferring it from academy to industry. Academic researchers and industrial practitioners both expect that more and more technologies can be transferred. However, there is always a wide gap between RT research and practice. In this thesis, I'll propose a novel model that focuses on evaluating the RT technologies transfer maturity. A reasonable maturity evaluation model is proposed to measure to what extent an academic RT technology must achieve before it is able to be transferred to industry. Based on the model, an initial progress is made in selecting a suitable RT technology for industrial practitioners.",0
On the Alignment of Source Code Quality Perspectives through Experimentation: An Industrial Case,"CONTEXT. Alignment is a key factor for success in many software development projects. Aligned teams are capable of bringing collaboration and positive results to companies; whereas misalignment among developers can make a conflicted environment and even lead the project to failure. OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed - e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints - along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company.",0
Transferring interactive search-based software testing to industry,"Context: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST), and the wider area of Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE), is the application of optimization algorithms to problems in software testing, and software engineering, respectively. New algorithms, methods, and tools are being developed and validated on benchmark problems. In previous work, we have also implemented and evaluated Interactive Search-Based Software Testing (ISBST) tool prototypes, with a goal to successfully transfer the technique to industry. Objective: While SBST and SBSE solutions are often validated on benchmark problems, there is a need to validate them in an operational setting, and to assess their performance in practice. The present paper discusses the development and deployment of SBST tools for use in industry, and reflects on the transfer of these techniques to industry. Method: In addition to previous work discussing the development and validation of an ISBST prototype, a new version of the prototype ISBST system was evaluated in the laboratory and in industry. This evaluation is based on an industrial System under Test (SUT) and was carried out with industrial practitioners. The Technology Transfer Model is used as a framework to describe the progression of the development and evaluation of the ISBST system, as it progresses through the first five of its seven steps. Results: The paper presents a synthesis of previous work developing and evaluating the ISBST prototype, as well as presenting an evaluation, in both academia and industry, of that prototypeâ€™s latest version. In addition to the evaluation, the paper also discusses the lessons learned from this transfer. Conclusions: This paper presents an overview of the development and deployment of the ISBST system in an industrial setting, using the framework of the Technology Transfer Model. We conclude that the ISBST system is capable of evolving useful test cases for that setting, though improvements in the means the system uses to communicate that information to the user are still required. In addition, a set of lessons learned from the project are listed and discussed. Our objective is to help other researchers that wish to validate search-based systems in industry, and provide more information about the benefits and drawbacks of these systems.",0
Research on effectiveness of technology transfer in technology alliances: evidence from Turkish SMEs,"Many SMEs homed in newly industrialised countries are successful international players despite limited technological infrastructure and R&D resources. This study bridges a gap in the extant literature by examining the relationships between characteristics of partnership relationships, knowledge sharing and the effectiveness of technology transfer in partnerships between SMEs in developing countries and firms from developed countries. By studying data from Turkish SMEs and using partial least squares structural equation modelling, we find that explicit knowledge sharing forms the basis of technology transfer. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that explicit knowledge sharing is strongly contingent upon formalised technical support while trust and technical support seemed to be important antecedents of tacit knowledge sharing.",0
Use case of self-organizing adaptive supply chain,"The main drivers for the development and implementation of self-organizing adap- tive operation processes are the increase of flexibility while lowering costs in times of growing consumer demands, shaping the supply chain into ?the source of en- terprises core competence?. This paper is based on the ?Guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering? and it demonstrates the design of the self-organizing adaptive supply chain through an integration of processes and systems. As a result, the automated near real-time data flow enables shorter order-lead-time with a high accuracy of information. Although the study includes the architecture for the self-organizing adaptive supply chain, it cannot be completely standardized due to individual processes and IT-systems within different companies. Academics and practitioners may find it useful to identify appropriate scenarios while looking for the ways to digitize their supply chains.",0
"Models, processes, and roles of universities in technology transfer management: A systematic review","Universities play pivotal roles when research findings are to be adopted commercially. Although these roles vary from one country to another, effective patenting and licensing procedures, as well as eventual commercialisation of scholarly inventions, reflect hard work on the part of the University mediating between the researcher and the industry through technology transfer offices (TTOs) in order to ensure that knowledge-developers take motivational and monetary credit for their findings. This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of university?industry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.",0
On the Impact of Semantic Transparency on Understanding and Reviewing Social Goal Models,"Context: i* is one of the most influential languages in the Requirements Engineering research community. Perhaps due to its complexity and low adoption in industry, it became a natural candidate for studies aiming at improving its concrete syntax and the stakeholders' ability to correctly interpret i* models. Objectives: We evaluate the impact of semantic transparency on understanding and reviewing i* models, in the presence of a language key. Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback. Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax. Conclusions: The context provided by the model and language key may mitigate the i* symbol recognition deficit reported in previous works. However, the alternative concrete syntax required a significantly lower visual effort.",0
Software-Intensive Product Engineering in Start-Ups: A Taxonomy,"Software start-ups are new companies aiming to launch an innovative product to mass markets fast with minimal resources. However, most start-ups fail before realizing their potential. Poor software engineering, among other factors, could be a significant contributor to the challenges that start-ups experience. Little is known about the engineering context in start-up companies. On the surface, start-ups are characterized by uncertainty, high risk, and minimal resources. However, such a characterization isn't granular enough to support identification of specific engineering challenges and to devise start-up-specific engineering practices. The first step toward an understanding of software engineering in start-ups is the definition of a Start-Up Context Map-a taxonomy of engineering practices, environment factors, and goals influencing the engineering process. This map aims to support further research on the field and serve as an engineering decision support tool for start-ups. This article is part of a theme issue on Process Improvement.",0
Supporting defect causal analysis in practice with cross-company data on causes of requirements engineering problems,"[Context] Defect Causal Analysis (DCA) represents an efficient practice to improve software processes. While knowledge on cause-effect relations is helpful to support DCA, collecting cause-effect data may require significant effort and time. [Goal] We propose and evaluate a new DCA approach that uses cross-company data to support the practical application of DCA. [Method] We collected cross-company data on causes of requirements engineering problems from 74 Brazilian organizations and built a Bayesian network. Our DCA approach uses the diagnostic inference of the Bayesian network to support DCA sessions. We evaluated our approach by applying a model for technology transfer to industry and conducted three consecutive evaluations: (i) in academia, (ii) with industry representatives of the Fraunhofer Project Center at UFBA, and (iii) in an industrial case study at the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES). [Results] We received positive feedback in all three evaluations and the cross-company data was considered helpful for determining main causes. [Conclusions] Our results strengthen our confidence in that supporting DCA with cross-company data is promising and should be further investigated.",0
Safety Practices in Requirements Engineering: The Uni-REPM Safety Module,"Context: Software is an important part in safety-critical system (SCS) development since it is becoming a major source of hazards. Requirements-related hazards have been associated with many accidents and safety incidents. Requirements issues tend to be mitigated in companies with high processes maturity levels since they do their business in a systematic, consistent and proactive approach. However, requirements engineers need systematic guidance to consider safety concerns early in the development process. Goal: the paper investigates which safety practices are suitable to be used in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process for SCS and how to design a safety maturity model for this area. Method: we followed the design science methodology to propose Uni-REPM SCS, a safety module for Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model (Uni-REPM). We also conducted a static validation with two practitioners and nine academic experts to evaluate its coverage, correctness, usefulness, and applicability. Results: The module has seven main processes, fourteen sub-processes and 148 practices that form the basis of safety processes maturity. Moreover, we describe its usage through a tool. Conclusions: The validation indicates a good coverage of practices and well receptivity by the experts. Finally, the module can help companies in evaluating their current practices.",0
Mutual knowledge transfer between industry and academia to improve testing withdefect taxonomies,Software engineering is an applied research area preferably conducted jointly by academia and industry to enable transfer of knowledge in both directions and at the end improvement software engineering in industry. In this paper we present how the required mutual knowledge transfer via empirical evaluation was performed to improve testing with defect taxonomies in industry.,0
Experimental validation of a risk assessment method,"[Context and motivation] It is desirable that requirement engineering methods are reliable, that is, that methods can be repeated with the same results. Risk assessments methods, however, often have low reliability when they identify risk mitigations for a system based on expert judgement. [Question/problem] Our goal is to assess the reliability of an availability risk assessment method for telecominfrastructures, and to identify possibilities for improvement of its reliability. [Principal ideas/results] We propose an experimental validation of reliability, and report on its application. We give a detailed analysis of sources of variation, explain how we controlled them and validated their mitigations, and motivate the statistical procedure used to analyse the outcome. [Contribution] Our results can be used to improve the reliability of risk assessment methods. Our approach to validating reliability can be useful for the assessment of the reliability of other methods.",0
LoCo CoCo: Automatically constructing coordination and communication networks from model-based systems engineering data,"Context: Communication and coordination are essential ingredients to successful requirements and software engineering. However, especially in large organisations, it is difficult to establish and maintain communication channels. Objective: In order to facilitate communication, we investigate automatic construction of social network models from existing requirements and systems engineering models. Method: We conducted a design science research study in three iterative cycles at a large automotive company, and evaluated the outcome based on 15 interviews with practitioners and a survey with 12 participants. Results: The resulting approach, denoted LoCo CoCo, automatically creates and visualises social networks based on selected systems engineering components of real-life, productive systems engineering models. Our results indicate that automatic construction and visualisation of social network models could be feasible and useful to overcome existing communication challenges. Conclusion: Despite a lack of quality in existing social data at the case company, practitioners found LoCo CoCo potentially helpful to overcome existing communication challenges. Additionally, the visualisation could trigger practitioners to keep their social data up to date.",0
Applying Automated Test Case Generation in Industry: A Retrospective,"Automated test case generation promises to reduce the high effort of manually developing and maintaining test cases, to improve the effectiveness of testing, and to speed-up testing cycles. Research on generating test cases has advanced over the past decades and today a wide range of techniques and tools are available, including studies showing their successful evaluation in real-world scenarios. We conducted a multi-firm research project on automated software testing that involved the application of automated test case generation approaches in industry projects. This paper provides a retrospective on the related activities. It reports on our observations and insights from applying automated test case generation in practice, identifies pitfalls and gaps in current research, and summarizes lessons learned from transferring software testing research results to industry.",0
Valorization of assistive technologies for cognition: Lessons and practices,"A growing body of literature suggests that Assistive Technologies for Cognition (ATCs) are efficient at improving independence and life participation of persons with cognitive impairments. Despite years of research, ATCs implementation in the field of cognitive rehabilitation remains a real challenge. These intervention tools are still not common in clinics and only a few assistive technologies developed in research reach the commercialization phase. This chapter discusses difficulties with regard to the valorization of ATCs and their widespread adoption and provides a reflective tool to optimize the implementation of cognitive assistants.",0
On evidence-based risk management in requirements engineering,"Background: The sensitivity of Requirements Engineering (RE) to the context makes it difficult to efficiently control problems therein, thus, hampering an effective risk management devoted to allow for early corrective or even preventive measures. Problem: There is still little empirical knowledge about context-specific RE phenomena which would be necessary for an effective context-sensitive risk management in RE. Goal: We propose and validate an evidence-based approach to assess risks in RE using cross-company data about problems, causes and effects. Research Method: We use survey data from 228 companies and build a probabilistic network that supports the forecast of context-specific RE phenomena. We implement this approach using spreadsheets to support a light-weight risk assessment. Results: Our results from an initial validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further allows for disseminating our approach into practice.",0
Optimization of the technology transfer process using gantt charts and critical path analysis flow diagrams: Case study of the korean automobile industry,"This research is focused on the technology transfer process in the automobile industry using project management tools. The aim of this research is the development of a technology-transfer model using Gantt charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams to achieve a sustainable planning process in the global environment. To achieve this goal, the authors use Gantt charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams. The hypothesis and three research questions are presented, which suggest a relationship between project management tools and the sustainable planning process of technology transfer. During the research, we use the case study of the Korean automobile industry as an excellent example of the technology-transfer process in global markets. A single project of technology transfer is discussed: the technology knowledge transfer from Korean headquarters to a Russian manufacturing subsidiary (Hyundai Motor Corporation). Quantitative data were collected through the open resources of the corporation; the qualitative data were analyzed through a case study and model parameter evaluation. The significant result that the combination of Gantt Charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams methods improves the planning process for technology-transfer projects was found in this survey. It is noticed that (a) it is useful to apply project-management tools for technology transferring models; (b) Gantt Charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams have a sustainable impact on technology transfer projects; and (c) critical paths and operational reserves in network diagrams help to optimize the planning process for technology transfer",0
A platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems,"Providing valid architecture information to stakeholders remains a challenge, as the effort required for documenting and maintaining this information over a longer period of time is very high. Automatically and continuously extracting architecture information from the system implementation makes it possible to document and keep architecture information up-to-date. In large software systems, architecture extraction has to deal with the continuous and efficient extraction of architectural information from very large code bases. In cooperation with a company from the financial sector, we have developed over several years a platform for the automatic extraction and provision of architectural information for large-scale service-oriented software systems. The platform was evaluated in a real industrial environment. The results of this evaluation show that it can provide up-to-date architectural information for large code bases on a daily basis. It also provides information on the trustworthiness of the extracted information and how it can be improved.",0
A Chatbot for goal-oriented requirements modeling,"Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering approaches, in which the KAOS framework plays a key role, have been widely used for eliciting software requirements because they provide an easier way of communicating among stakeholders. However, the goal-oriented requirements modeling is not an easy way for novice requirements engineers. These professionals need more support in creating KAOS models. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g., Natural Language Processing ? NLP) to support Requirements Engineering activities. In this sense, this paper aims to describe a way to support requirements elicitation for novice requirements engineers through the use of NLP within a chatbot. The chatbot (KAOSbot) acts as a KAOS modeling assistant. To evaluate our hypotheses about perceived efficacy from the novice requirements engineers perspective, we performed a quasi-experiment concerning KAOSbot?s perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. The results show that KAOSbot tool is a promising approach for specifying KAOS models because it was perceived as easy to use, useful, and the participants intend to use it in the future.",0
Estimating Energy Impact of Software Releases and Deployment Strategies: The KPMG Case Study,"Background. Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products. Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure. Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption. Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency. Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.",0
Evaluating the efficacy of value-driven methods: a controlled experiment,"A value model is an abstract representation of an organization and is used for capturing and describing the rationale of how the organization creates, delivers, and captures business value. Value-driven development methods use the notion of ?economic value exchange? to define more efficient business strategies and align Information Systems with the organization goals. However, current value-driven methods are complex and there is not enough empirical evidence about which of the existing methods is more effective under what circumstances. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a controlled experiment aimed at comparing the Dynamic Value Description (DVD) method, which is a recently defined cognitive early requirements approach, with the well-known e3value method, with respect to their effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. The results show that DVD has proved to be a promising method for specifying business value.",0
Threat modeling: from infancy to maturity,"Threat modeling involves the systematic identification and analysis of security threats in the context of a specific system. This paper starts from an assessment of its current state of practice, based on interactions with threat modeling professionals. We argue that threat modeling is still at a low level of maturity and identify the main criteria for successful adoption in practice. Furthermore, we identify a set of key research challenges for aligning threat modeling research to industry practice, thereby raising the technology-readiness levels of the ensuing solutions, approaches, and tools.",0
TestDCat 3.0: catalog of test debt subtypes and management activities,"When deadlines and resources of software projects become scarce, testing is usually in the first row to have its activities aborted or reduced; however, if defects cannot be found, product quality can be affected. In the software development process, aborted or reduced activities that can bring short-term benefits, but can be harmful to the project in the long run, are considered Technical Debt (TD) and, when the TDs impact testing activities, they are called Test Debt. Although there are several studies dealing with Test Debt, current solutions often deal with specific types of tests (e.g., exploratory and automated tests) and do not address the whole software testing process. Aiming to fill these gaps, this work then proposes a Test Debt Catalog, called TestDCat, with subtypes of Test Debts and Technical Debt management activities. This catalog is built based on the results of an empirical study, a literature review and semi-structured interviews conducted with practitioners who perform testing activities on five projects from industry. For the TestDCat evaluation, a case study is conducted in real projects in order to identify if the catalog is user-friendly and if its use helps the Test Debt management during the execution of test activities in these software development projects.",0
Quality-aware rapid software development project: the Q-rapids project,"Software quality poses continuously new challenges in software development, including aspects related to both software development and system usage, which significantly impact the success of software systems. The Q-Rapids H2020 project defines an evidence-based, data-driven quality-aware rapid software development methodology. Quality requirements (QRs) are incrementally elicited, refined and improved based on data gathered from software repositories, project management tools, system usage and quality of service. This data is analysed and aggregated into quality-related key strategic indicators (e.g., development effort required to include a given QR in the next development cycle) which are presented to decision makers using a highly informative dashboard. The Q-Rapids platform is being evaluated in-premises by the four companies participating in the consortium, reporting useful lessons learned and directions for new development.",0
A Conceptual UX-Aware Model of Requirements,"User eXperience (UX) is becoming increasingly important for success of software products. Yet, many companies still face various challenges in their work with UX. Part of these challenges relate to inadequate knowledge and awareness of UX and that current UX models are commonly not practical nor well integrated into existing Software Engineering (SE) models and concepts. Therefore, we present a conceptual UX-aware model of requirements for software development practitioners. This layered model shows the interrelation between UX and functional and quality requirements. The model is developed based on current models of UX and software quality characteristics. Through the model we highlight the main differences between various requirement types in particular essentially subjective and accidentally subjective quality requirements. We also present the result of an initial validation of the model through interviews with 12 practitioners and researchers. Our results show that the model can raise practitioners? knowledge and awareness of UX in particular in relation to requirement and testing activities. It can also facilitate UX-related communication among stakeholders with different backgrounds.",0
Piggybacking on an Autonomous Hauler: Business Models Enabling a System-of-Systems Approach to Mapping an Underground Mine,"With ever-increasing productivity targets in mining operations, there is a growing interest in mining automation. In future mines, remote controlled and autonomous haulers will operate underground guided by LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensors. We envision reusing LiDAR measurements to maintain accurate mine maps that would contribute to both safety and productivity. Extrapolating from a pilot project on reliable wireless communication in Boliden's Kankberg mine, we propose establishing a System-of-Systems (SoS) with LiDAR-equipped haulers and existing mapping solutions as constituent systems. SoS requirements engineering inevitably adds a political layer, as independent actors are stakeholders both on the system and SoS levels. We present four SoS scenarios representing different business models, discussing how development and operations could be distributed among Boliden and external stakeholders, e.g., the vehicle suppliers, the hauling company, and the developers of the mapping software. Based on eight key variation points, we compare the four scenarios from both technical and business perspectives. Finally, we validate our findings in a seminar with participants from the relevant stakeholders. We conclude that to determine which scenario is the most promising for Boliden, trade-offs regarding control, costs, risks, and innovation must be carefully evaluated.",0
"Lean Development in Design Science Research: Deliberating Principles, Prospects and Pitfalls","[Context and motivation:] As a relevant and viable research methodology that addresses the development and empirical investigation of new artifacts, design science research (DSR) has gained traction in the requirements and software engineering research community over the past decade. [Question/Problem:] In this paper, we deliberate the synergies between the lean mindset and DSR, and explore the application of lean development approaches in the planning and execution of software and requirements engineering research projects. [Principal idea:] The widespread adoption of lean approaches in many business and technology practices today provides the impetus to explore their application in the context of software and requirements engineering empirical research. Toward this, we offer a review of key principles underlying the lean mindset and provide an overview of the typical processes followed in DSR research projects. Subsequently, we reflect the potential for lean development approaches to facilitate DSR projects. [Contribution:] We propose a conceptual framework that integrates lean principles with DSR phases and outputs, and we aim to inspire future discussion on the application of the lean mindset in the planning and execution of empirical research projects.",0
Supporting Diagnosis of Requirements Violations in Systems of Systems,"Industrial software systems are often systems of systems (SoS) whose full behavior only emerges during operation. They therefore require monitoring techniques to observe systems and detect deviations from their requirements. The focus of existing monitoring approaches, however, is mainly on detecting violations of expected behavior, while support for diagnosing violations is typically limited or even neglected. Diagnosis is particularly challenging in SoS due to their technological heterogeneity and the diversity of development tools in use. Uncovering the root cause of a violation typically requires developers to trace violations to artifacts such as source code or requirements documents, which is difficult without detailed domain knowledge. In this paper we describe our experiences of developing a tool-supported approach facilitating the diagnosis of requirements violations in SoS. We describe how we complemented a requirements monitoring model with a system artifact model relating SoS artifacts needed for diagnosis with monitored events. We customized our approach to an industrial SoS and conducted a scenario-based walkthrough with engineers developing the SoS and engineers and researchers unfamiliar with it. The results of our evaluation have shown that our approach can significantly ease diagnosing violations in a real-world SoS.",0
Assessment of Safety Processes in Requirements Engineering,"Context: Requirements issues tend to be mitigated in organizations with high process maturity levels since they do their business in a systematic, consistent and proactive approach. In a Safety-Critical System (SCS), requirements problems have been associated with accidents and safety incidents. Objective: This work investigates which safety practices/actions are suitable to be used in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of SCS and how to design a safety maturity model for this area. Method: we adopted different empirical techniques to propose Uni-REPM SCS, which consists of a safety module to be included in the Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model (Uni-REPM). Results: The safety module has seven main processes, 14 sub-processes and 148 safety actions describing principles and practices that form the basis of safety processes maturity. Conclusions: Preliminary validation with two practitioners and nine academic experts indicates that the safety module can help organizations to evaluate their current safety practices with respect to their RE process. Moreover, it also offers a step-wise improvement strategy to raise their safety maturity level.",0
Requirements Engineering as Innovation Journalism: A Research Preview,"The successful launch of an innovation project depends on an attractive vision and how well the vision is supported by the complementary capabilities of the consortium partners that want to cooperate to realize the vision. Alas, for an innovator the search for the right partners and visions can be lengthy and difficult. Even though the analysis of context and problem, the identification of stakeholders, the analysis of stakeholder goals and techno-logical capabilities, and the definition of requirements belong to the cornerstones of requirements engineering, this requirements engineering problem has hardly been explored so far. In an attempt to avoid re-invention of well-tried solutions, we discovered journalism as a discipline that, as a rich body of methodical knowledge, may act as a source for the guidance of how a requirements engineer may support the launch of innovation projects. In the role of a journalist, the requirements engineer makes partners and their capabilities visible and thereby allows the parties to identify each other and meet. The transparency that develops between the parties becomes an instrument for consortia to emerge and to eventually answer calls for innovation with appropriate visions for innovation projects. This paper introduces the problem of initiating innovation projects and describes the potential role of journalism as a metaphor for addressing the problem. The paper also describes our plans in designing an innovation journalism approach that we hope will enable requirements engineers to increase innovation potential and ease the launch of projects that bring about these innovations.",0
A Model-Based Framework for Legal Policy Simulation and Legal Compliance Checking,"Analyzing legal policies for many laws, such as taxes and social benefits, is a common way for governments to identify risks, e.g., risk of legal policies not achieving expected revenue. A typical analysis includes validation of policies and the verification of the systems implementing them. One efficient way to validate policies is simulation, e.g., by simulating whether a proposed law reform would realize target objectives. Once validated, policies are implemented into public administration procedures and eGovernment applications. Systems implementing legal policies also need to be analyzed and verified, e.g., through testing, to ensure that they are compliant with the underlying policies. Currently, legal policy analysis is conducted using a combination of spreadsheets and software code. Such strategy suffers mainly from being hard to use by legal experts due to the lack of adequate background. This is partly rooted in the fact that available techniques to formalize legal policies are based on complex logical expressions and code. The main goal of this research project, that this paper describes, is to narrow the aforementioned expertise gap by proposing convenient, systematic and automated techniques to support analysis of legal polices from their design to their implementation.",0
On the Industrial Applicability of Augmented Testing: An Empirical Study,"Testing applications with graphical user Interfaces (GUI) is an important but also a time-consuming task in practice. Tools and frameworks for GUI test automation can make the test execution more efficient and lower the manual labor required for regression testing. However, the test scripts used for automated GUI-based testing still require a substantial development effort and are often reported as sensitive to change, leading to frequent and costly maintenance. The efficiency of development, maintenance, and evolution of such tests are thereby dependent on the readability of scripts and the ease-of-use of test tools/frameworks in which the test scripts are defined. To address these shortcomings in existing state-of-practice techniques, a novel technique referred to as Augmented Testing (AT) has been proposed. AT is defined as testing the System Under Test (SUT) through an Augmented GUI that superimposes information on top of the SUT GUI. The Augmented GUI can provide the user with hints, test data, or other support while also observing and recording the tester's interactions. For this study, a prototype tool, called Scout, has been used that adheres to the AT concept that is evaluated in an industrial empirical study. In the evaluation, quasi-experiments and questionnaire surveys are performed in two workshops, with 12 practitioners from two Swedish companies (Ericsson and Inceptive). Results show that Scout can be used to create equivalent test cases faster, with statistical significance, than creating automated scripts in two popular state-of-practice tools. The study concludes that AT has cost-value benefits, applies to industrial-grade software, and overcomes several deficiencies of state-of-practice GUI testing technologies in terms of ease-of-use.",0
Artifact Compatibility for Enabling Collaboration in the Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem,Different types of software components and data have to be combined to solve an artificial intelligence challenge. An emerging marketplace for these components will allow for their exchange and distribution. To facilitate and boost the collaboration on the marketplace a solution for finding compatible artifacts is needed. We propose a concept to define compatibility on such a marketplace and suggest appropriate scenarios on how users can interact with it to support the different types of required compatibility. We also propose an initial architecture that derives from and implements the compatibility principles and makes the scenarios feasible. We matured our concept in focus group workshops and interviews with potential marketplace users from industry and academia. The results demonstrate the applicability of the concept in a real-world scenario.,0
Evaluating and strategizing the onboarding of software developers in large-scale globally distributed projects,"The combination of scale and distribution in software projects makes the onboarding of new developers problematic. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the relationship between onboarding strategies and the performance evolution of newcomers in large-scale, globally distributed projects. Furthermore, there are no approaches to support the development of strategies to systematically onboard developers. In this paper, we address these gaps by means of an industrial case study. We identified that the following aspects seem to be related to the observed onboarding results: the distance to mentors, the formal training approach used, the allocation of large and distributed tasks in the early stages of the onboarding process, and team instability. We conclude that onboarding must be planned well ahead and should consider avoiding the aspects mentioned above. Based on the results of this investigation, we propose a process to strategize and evaluate onboarding. To develop the process, we used business process modeling. We conducted a static validation of the proposed process utilizing interviews with experts. The static validation of the process indicates that it can help companies to deal with the challenges associated with the onboarding of newcomers through more systematic, effective, and repeatable onboarding strategies.",0
Key management processes to technology transfer success,"The success rate of technology transfer from government laboratories is quite low. This paper combines findings from academic research to provide valuable managerial insights. We conclude that technology transfer factors identified so far actually relate to four management processes: project management, strategy management, innovation management, and relationship management.",0
Practical experiences and value of applying software analytics to manage quality,"Background: Despite the growth in the use of software analytics platforms in industry, little empirical evidence is available about the challenges that practitioners face and the value that these platforms provide. Aim: The goal of this research is to explore the benefits of using a software analytics platform for practitioners managing quality. Method: In a technology transfer project, a software analytics platform was incrementally developed between academic and industrial partners to address their software quality problems. This paper focuses on exploring the value provided by this software analytics platform in two pilot projects. Results: Practitioners emphasized major benefits including the improvement of product quality and process performance and an increased awareness of product readiness. They especially perceived the semi-automated functionality of generating quality requirements by the software analytics platform as the benefit with the highest impact and most novel value for them. Conclusions: Practitioners can benefit from modern software analytics platforms, especially if they have time to adopt such a platform carefully and integrate it into their quality assurance activities.",0
Improving classification accuracy in crowdsourcing through hierarchical reorganization,"In this paper, we propose a method of improving accuracy of multiclass classification tasks in crowdsourcing. In order to improve quality of outputs in crowdsourcing, it is important to assign workers to tasks they are good at. In multiclass classification tasks, which are common in crowdsourcing, sometimes different workers are good at different subcategories. It suggests that we can improve the accuracy of a multiclass classification task by reorganizing the task into a hierarchical classification task, and assigning workers to appropriate sub-tasks in the hierarchy. We experimentally show that we can actually improve the accuracy of a classification task by this approach. We collected performance data of workers in a flat multiclass classification task on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and simulated the process of the reorganization and the worker allocation. We confirmed that the output in the simulation achieves higher accuracy than that of the original flat classification task.",0
An Investigation into Inner Source Software Development: Preliminary Findings from a Systematic Literature Review,"Given the value and effectiveness of open source software development to date, practitioners are keen to replicate these practices inside their respective corporations. This application of open source practices inside the confines of a corporate entity has been coined inner source software development. However, while organisations have found ways to directly benefit from revenue streams as a result of leveraging open source practices internally, the current research on inner source is scattered among different areas. Thus gaining clarity on the state-of-the-art in inner source research is challenging. In particular, there is no systematic literature review of known research to date on inner source. We address this challenge by presenting a systematic literature review that identifies, critically evaluates and integrates the findings of 29 primary studies on inner source. Case study approach is the common research approach undertaken in the area. We also identified 8 frameworks/methods, models and tools proposed in the literature to support inner source, as well as a set of benefits and challenges associated with inner source. We envision future work to perform deeper analysis and synthesis on the empirical research on inner source software development.",0
"Modeling and Simulation as a Service infrastructure capabilities for discovery, composition and execution of simulation services","Modeling and Simulation as a Service (MSaaS) embodies the idea that simulations should be composed quickly for the task at hand from loosely coupled shared components, simulation services, in a cloud-based environment. These simulations are then offered, as composed simulation services, to human and technical consumers. Instrumental to this, is functionality that lets a simulation operator discover and compose simulation services and execute the composition. We describe this functionality in terms of what we call MSaaS infrastructure capabilities. Following the idea of stepwise refinement, the discovery and composition of simulation services can be done at design time using implementation-independent information about simulation services and at implementation time using implementation-specific information about simulation services. The execution environment can also be set up at design time and at implementation time. We therefore describe the MSaaS infrastructure capabilities in terms of how they are used on both implementation-independent and implementation-specific service information. By doing these elaborations, we intend to gain greater insight into how to perform simulation service discovery, composition, and execution. We conclude that although much of the required functionality for a MSaaS infrastructure is available through existing platforms and frameworks, it is necessary to offer this functionality as services, alongside (composed) simulation services, to fulfill the MSaaS vision.",0
Knowledge and technology transfer in sustainability reports: Fomenting stakeholder engagement for sustainable development,"This article aimed to propose and test a model to assess the potential of sustainability reporting (SR) standards as facilitators for knowledge and technology transfer (KTT), the Sustainable Reporting Knowledge and Technology Transfer (SURKaTT) Model. The proposed model can be used mainly by researchers and public organizations that intend to or are currently conducting SR initiatives. It can be used to assess and compare SR standards, being a facilitator to KTT processes. GRI, a worldwide well-known SR standard was assessed using the SURKaTT Model, and results show that GRI performed at only 58.8% of its potential to facilitate KTT processes. This pioneering approach can encourage researchers onto developing further criteria to assess the possibilities of KTT in SR, and it is a kick-off start for SR to be considered a both purposeful and serendipitous source of KTT initiatives.",0
Technology transfer oriented to sustainable development: proposal of a theoretical model based on barriers and opportunities,"Until the year 2030, the objectives and targets proposed in the Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals need to be achieved, aiming to minimize various global problems. Bearing in mind this urgency, it is necessary that studies to help achieve these objectives be carried out. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to carry out a Systematic Literature Review of the technology transfer models existing in the literature, since the process can assist in promoting sustainable development, as well as possible barriers and opportunities for sustainable technology transfer processes. The results show that, despite the diversity of models available in the literature, there is an absence of a model that considers the sphere of sustainable development, and the possible barriers and opportunities in the formulation of its stages. Based on this, a conceptual Barriers and Opportunities-based model focused on sustainable development was proposed, aiming to fill the scientific gap found, thus contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. The model has four macro steps: Plan; Enable; Implement and Evaluate, which range from identifying the technological need to documentation, registration, and feedback on implementation. As a result, the model can anticipate and address possible barriers, making use of opportunities as facilitators. Also, this research contributes to the governmental sphere, since with the use of the model it is expected that it can assist in the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals.",0
"What to share, when, and where: balancing the objectives and complexities of open source software contributions","Context: Software-intensive organizations? rationale for sharing Open Source Software (OSS) may be driven by both idealistic, strategic and commercial objectives, and include both monetary as well as non-monetary benefits. To gain the potential benefits, an organization may need to consider what they share and how, while taking into account risks, costs and other complexities. Objective: This study aims to empirically investigate objectives and complexities organizations need to consider and balance between when deciding on what software to share as OSS, when to share it, and whether to create a new or contribute to an existing community. Method: A multiple-case study of three case organizations was conducted in two research cycles, with data gathered from interviews with 20 practitioners from these organizations. The data was analyzed qualitatively in an inductive and iterative coding process. Results: 12 contribution objectives and 15 contribution complexities were found. Objectives include opportunities for improving reputation, managing suppliers, managing partners and competitors, and exploiting externally available knowledge and resources. Complexities include risk of loosing control, risk of giving away competitive advantage, risk of creating negative exposure, costs of contributing, and the possibility and need to contribute to an existing or new community. Conclusions: Cross-case analysis and interview validation show that the identified objectives and complexities offer organizations a possibility to reflect on and adapt their contribution strategies based on their specific contexts and business goals.",0
Using a Context-Aware Approach to Recommend Code Reviewers: Findings from an Industrial Case Study,"Code review is a commonly used practice in software development. It refers to the process of reviewing new code changes before they are merged with the code base. However, to perform the review, developers are mostly assigned manually to code changes. This may lead to problems such as: a time-consuming selection process, limited pool of known candidates and risk of over-allocation of a few reviewers. To address the above problems, we developed Carrot, a machine learning-based tool to recommend code reviewers. We conducted an improvement case study at Ericsson. We evaluated Carrot using a mixed approach. we evaluated the prediction accuracy using historical data and the metrical Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Furthermore, we deployed the tool in one Ericsson project and evaluated how adequate the recommendations were from the point of view of the tool users and the recommended reviewers. We also asked the opinion of senior developers about the usefulness of the tool. The results show that Carrot can help identify relevant non-obvious reviewers and be of great assistance to new developers. However, there were mixed opinions on Carrot's ability to assist with workload balancing and the decrease code review lead time.",0
Framework for Analysis of Multi-party Collaboration,"In recent years, platforms have become important for allowing ecosystems to emerge that allow users to collaborate and create unprecedented forms of innovation. For the platform provider, the ecosystem represents a massive business opportunity if the platform succeeds to make the collaborations among the users value-creating and to facilitate trust. While the requirements flow for evolving existing ecosystems is understood, it is unclear how to analyse an ecosystem that is to be. In this paper, we draw on recent work on collaboration modelling in requirements engineering and propose an integrated framework for the analysis of multi-party collaboration that is to be supported by a platform. Drawing on a real-world case, we describe how the framework is applied and the results that have been obtained with it. The results indicate that the framework was useful to understand the ecosystem context for a planned platform in the domain of artificial intelligence, allowed identification of platform requirements and offered a basis to plan validation.",0
Model-based Automation of Test Script Generation Across Product Variants: a Railway Perspective,"In this work, we report on our experience in defining and applying a model-based approach for the automatic generation of test scripts for product variants in software product lines. The proposed approach is the result of an effort leveraging the experiences and results from the technology transfer activities with our industrial partner Bombardier Transportation. The proposed approach employs metamodelling and model transformations for representing different testing artefacts and making their generation automatic. We demonstrate the industrial applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach using the Bombardier Transportation Aventra software product line. We observe that the proposed approach mitigates the development effort, time consumption and consistency drawbacks typical of traditional strategies.",0
Scalable Software Testing and Verification for Industrial-Scale Systems: The Challenges,"In this position paper, we argue that more collaborative research is needed to increase the use of research-led verification and testing techniques in industrial- scale projects. We focus on the a) practical applicability and scalability of verifica- tion and testing techniques in industrial projects, and b) to autonomous systems. We identify the challenges involved and bring forward some initial suggestions.",0
Programming Language Adoption as an Epidemiological Phenomenon,"In Software Engineering, technology transfer has been faced as a peer to peer problem, concerning only the adoption and innovation agents. This approach works well when one is just seeking the adoption of a technology by a specific client, but it can not solve a common problem that is the adoption of new technologies by a large mass of potential new users. In wider context, it no longer makes sense to focus on peer to peer transfer. A new way of looking at the problem is necessary. The diffusion of innovations is more natural when it is treated as a spread of information in a community, similar to that observed in epidemics. This work proposes a paradigm shift to show that the adoption of programming languages can be formally treated as an epidemic. This shift of focus allows the dynamics of adoption of programming languages to be mathematically modeled as such, defining models that explain the communities' behavior when adopting programming languages, and allows some forecast to be made.",0
Test automation with the Gauge framework: Experience and best practices,"While Behavior-driven development (BDD) tools such as Cucumber are powerful tools for automated testing, they have certain limitations. For example, they often enforce strict syntax for test cases, like the ?Given-When-Then? format, which may not always be easy to write for a given test case. A new test automation framework named Gauge (gauge.org) addresses that limitation since it does not prescribe the BDD testing process with a strict syntax. In Gauge, writing a test case is as easy as writing down the flow of test cases in several itemized sentences in a natural language, like English. In the context of Testinium (testinium.com), a large software testing company which provides software testing services, tools and solutions to a large number of clients, we have actively used the Gauge framework since 2018 to develop large automated front-end test suites for several large web applications. In this paper/talk, the speakers will share several examples and best practices of developing automated tests in natural-language requirements using the Gauge framework. By learning from the ideas presented in the talk, readers (attendees) will be able to consider applying the Gauge framework in their own test automation projects.",0
Continuous Management of Design- and Run-Time Artifacts for Self-Adaptive Systems,"With the rise of smart and autonomous systems, self-adaptation plays a significant role in the capabilities of software-intensive systems. When developing and operating self-adaptive systems, a growing amount of information is required. This information forms the basis to systems' evolution and adaptation at run time, but is also used at design time to evolve and maintain the systems. To support development organizations in the future, efficient ways to manage information throughout the systems' lifecycle are needed. However, there is currently a lack of methods to continuously manage artifacts for self-adaptive systems. In our research, we aim to close this gap by developing methods and techniques to manage both design-time and run-time artifacts. We conduct empirical studies to identify practitioners' needs and challenges. Then we develop innovative solutions and technologies and evaluate them in practical scenarios.",0
Reasoning about Research Quality Alignment in Software Engineering,"Context: Research quality is intended to assess the design and reporting of studies. It comprises a series of concepts such as methodological rigor, practical relevance, and conformance to ethical standards. Depending on the perspective, different views of importance are given to the conceptual dimensions of research quality. Objective: We aim to better understand what constitutes research quality from the perspective of the empirical software engineering community. In particular, we intend to assess the level of alignment between researchers with regard to a conceptual model of research quality. Method: We conducted a mixed methods approach comprising an internal case study and a complementary focus group. We carried out a hierarchical voting prioritization based on the conceptual model to collect relative values for importance. In the focus group, we also moderate discussions with experts to address potential misalignment. Results: We provide levels of alignment with regard to the importance of quality dimensions in the view of the participants. Moreover, the conceptual model fairly expresses the quality of research but has limitations with regards the structure and description of its components. Conclusion: Based on the results, we revised the conceptual model and provided an updated version adjusted to the context of empirical software engineering research. We also discussed how to assess quality alignment in research using our approach, and how to use the revised model of quality to characterize an assessment instrument.",0
Operations Technology and Organizational Structure.,"The aim of paper is to evaluate if technology transfer services of AREA Science Park support Open Innovation approaches realized by small and medium enterprises of Italian northeast region. An evaluation framework which crosses technology transfer services and Open Innovation approaches has been created. We have implemented the evaluation framework in eight case studies. The case studies have highlighted that the technology transfer services of AREA support the Open Innovation approaches. These services have produced completely positive outcomes for seven firms out of eight. The research has highlighted that the evaluation framework has a limit as well: it evaluates only if there is an impact, it doesn?t evaluate the quality of impact and its effects.",0
Success Factors for Technology Transfer in Government Laboratories,"The success rate of technology transfer from government laboratories is quite low. This paper combines findings from academic research and government policy reports to provide valuable managerial insights. We conclude that technology transfer factors identified so far actually relate to four management processes: project management, strategy management, innovation management, and relationship management. Case interviews are further conducted to validate the finding",0
Two Decades of Empirical Research on Developers' Information Needs: A Preliminary Analysis,"Over the last two decades, developers' daily intake of information has been constantly on the rise and so has the interest of research in investigating the information needs of developers. Knowledge about what information they seek and which sources they rely on is scarce and has to be updated regularly to match the rapid changes in development practices. In this paper, we reflect on the scientific studies published in this field over the last two decades. We present preliminary results of our analysis of a study sample where we particularly focus on the research methods used, the number of recruited participants, and the organisational context in which they emerged. We have investigated a total of 54 studies from 41 publications and found that convenience sampling is the predominant sampling strategy with a prevalence of the industrial organisational context. Moreover, the majority of studies had a reduced sample size and draw participants from a single organisation resulting in high sample homogeneity. Among the studies carried out in industry 51.9% recruited participants from Microsoft.",0
Adapting Behavior Driven Development (BDD) for large-scale software systems,"Context: Large-scale software projects require interaction between many stakeholders. Behavior-driven development (BDD) facilitates collaboration between stakeholders, and an adapted BDD process can help improve cooperation in a large-scale project. Objective: The objective of this study is to propose and empirically evaluate a BDD based process adapted for large-scale projects. Method: A technology transfer model was used to propose a BDD based process for large-scale projects. We conducted six workshop sessions to understand the challenges and benefits of BDD. Later, an industrial evaluation was performed for the process with the help of practitioners. Results: From our investigations, understanding of a business aspect of requirements, their improved quality, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts, and help for test organization are found as benefits of BDD. Practitioners identified the following challenges: specification and ownership of behaviors, adoption of new tools, the software projectsâ€™ scale, and versioning of behaviors. We proposed a process to address these challenges and evaluated the process with the help of practitioners. Conclusion: The evaluation proved that BDD could be adapted and used to facilitate interaction in large-scale software projects in the software industry. The feedback from the practitioners helped in improving the proposed process.",0
Industry-Academia Research Collaborations During and After COVID-19,"There exists a long-standing challenge of building successful research collaborations between industry and academia in software engineering. There are multiple reasons contributing to this issue, including different timelines, impact metrics, expectations, and perceptions of researchers and practitioners, altogether leading to the issue known as the industryacademia collaboration gap. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most researchers and practitioners were sent to work from home, relying on virtual collaboration with their peers, which might have given rise to an even wider industry-academia collaboration gap. At the 8th International Workshop on Software Engineering Research and Industrial Practice, held virtually at the International Conference on Software Engineering 2021, we investigate the impact that working from home has had on research collaborations between industry and academia. We also take a look at how remote work may change research collaborations in the future. In this report, we present takeaways from keynote talks on this matter, share insights from the panel of six experts on the topic of industry-academia collaborations, and finally summarize findings from related paper presentations.",0
THE ANALYSIS OF CONCEPTUAL THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IN FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES.,"The article overviews the existing models of technology transfer, including those within foreign universities, and highlights the most relevant ones that can be used by Russian universities in the post-COVID-19 conditions. The study should allow the university-based transfer centers to choose the model which is mostly suitable for their situation, and to include elements that will help them to maximize the efficiency of their activities. The existing centers will be able to make changes in their activity in order to update and/or to transform it in accordance with the changed conditions. For the management personnel of the university, the article also provides practical recommendations on managing technology transfer centers. The authors reveal the key functioning elements of various technology transfer models, which can be used by management personnel to design technology transfer centers based on Russian universities. The possible result of the stakeholders' getting to know this study might be their creating and implementing regulations to govern the technology transfer centers' activities; forming a personnel reserve; advanced existing personnel training and multi-competence teams' creating; forming a flexible budgetary policy, as well as a policy of values, for the technology transfer center to function within.",0
From AMALTHEA to RCM and Back: a Practical Architectural Mapping Scheme,"This paper focuses on the mapping between two industrial architectural languages: AMALTHEA and Rubus Component Model. Both languages are heavily used within the automotive domain for the design and timing analysis of automotive software, respectively. The main contribution of this paper is a mapping scheme between the two architectural languages enabling i) the translation of an AMALTHEA architecture into a Rubus Component Model architecture where high-precision timing analysis can be performed ii) and the back-propagation of the analysis results on the AMALTHEA architecture. We validate the applicability of the proposed mapping scheme using an industrial use case from the automotive domain: the brake-by-wire system. We discuss the industrial relevance and lessons learnt of this work using expert interviews.",0
How to Effectively Reduce Tens of Millions of Tests: An Industrial Case Study on Adaptive Random Testing,"Running and analyzing a large number of tests in an industrial scenario is labor intensive and time consuming. Hence, it is necessary to select a smaller number of tests for cost reduction as well as fault detection. For a type of nonnumeric systems, the linear-order algorithm for adaptive random testing (ART) (LART) technique is proposed by making tests evenly spread in nonnumeric input domains. To further enhance LART in the industrial scenarios where the number of input categories is too large, a new technique called category selection-based ART (CSBART), in which partial categories are selected to calculate tests' distances to guide LART, is proposed in this article. The fault-coverage effectiveness of CSBART is evaluated via an empirical study on two large scale billing systems with tens of millions of test cases, and the results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed CSBART. We also find that, after category selection, CSBART can outperform a more complex and widespread n-per cluster sampling technique that uses K-means clustering to certain extents.",0
Critical success factors in the stages of technological transfer from university to industry: study in the Andean countries,"Technology transfer (TT) is a tool for the development of societies and its success is affected by several factors; hence, it is important to identify them and note how they influence the different stages of the technology transfer process. The present work identifies new factors (adaptation to change, government policies, selection criterion of the project portfolio, work environment, product satisfaction, entropy, stress, and ethics), the same ones that have been supported in the theories of human and organisational behaviour, these affect all stages of the technology transfer process from university to industry. The study was made based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the model of structural equations and was carried out on 85 universities in four countries of the Andean region. The obtained results confirm that, at 95% confidence, the proposed factors influence all stages of the technology transfer process.",0
Transferring a model-based development methodology to the automotive industry,"This paper reports on our experience in transferring an academic model-based methodology for the development of automotive software systems into an industrial integrated development environment. The transferred methodology makes use of two industrial modelling languages and provides for the development and architectural exploration of automotive system and software designs with temporal awareness. We demonstrate the usage of the transferred methodology using the brake-by-wire automotive functionality. Eventually, we describe the challenges we have faced and the lessons we have learned in performing this technology transfer.",0
Government Strategies Towards IP Management,"Two Brazilian stories highlight why proper IP management is important for firms to develop a competitive advantage supported on a better use of the IP institutions. The first one involves the licensing of biodegradable chemical technology developed at the Chemistry Institute of Universidad de Campinas (Brazil) successfully licensed to Contech in 2007 by its tech transfer office, Agencia de Innovación Inova Unicamp. The patented technology contributed decisively to ensuring Contech?s leadership in the market by giving her time savings, as the production of paper could go on without the need to stop the machine for maintenance. The mechanical system applied biodegradable chemicals for pulp and paper machinery that did not hold up the production process. In return, the licensing agreement increased Inova?s budget, in a win-win situation.",0
Apprentice perceptions of work based learning: preliminary observations,"The degree apprenticeships programme involves a tripartite agreement involving the student apprentice, employer and the university. The programme introduced few years ago in the UK, which now caters to a significant number of apprentices in built environment related degree programmes. Although the Degree Apprenticeships involve a significant component of work based learning, limited evidence exist to justify Chartered Surveying Degree Apprenticeships Standard as a successful work based learning facilitator, mainly due to the scarcity of research. The findings of this paper are based on an ongoing research project, therefore is limited to evaluating Degree Apprenticeships apprentice perception of work based learning. Research method comprised of a literature review and the inspection of the guidance documents related to the delivery of the Degree Apprenticeships programme, followed by seven semi- structured interviews with selected degree apprentices. Qualitative data analysis paved the way for identification of several success areas and the aspects that require further improvement. Lack of shared understanding among the three parties and the absence of explicit evidence of implementation of work based learning were noteworthy, and suggestions for improvement are proposed. Further research involving a wider sample of apprentices and employers suggested.",0
Using Bayesian Networks to Support Managing Technological Risk on Software Projects,"Risk management is essential in software project management. It includes activities such as identifying, measuring and monitoring risks. The literature presents different approaches to support software risk management. In particular, the researchers popularly used Bayesian Networks because they can be learned from data or elicited from domain experts. Even though the literature presents many Bayesian networks (BN) for software risk management, none focus on technological risk factors. Given this, this paper presents a BN for managing risks of software projects and the results of a static validation performed through a focus group with eight practitioners. As a result, the practitioners agreed that our proposed to manage technological risks of software projects using BN is valuable and easy to use. Given the successful results, we concluded that the proposed solution is promising.",0
The Automotive Virtual Verification Ecosystem: Impediments and Enablers,"We describe the benefits of, critical impediments to, and crucial enablers for virtual verification.

Enabling automated integration of architectural languages: An experience report from the automotive domain,"Modern automotive software systems consist of hundreds of heterogeneous software applications, belonging to separated function domains and often developed within distributed automotive ecosystems consisting of original equipment manufactures, tier-1 and tier-2 companies. Hence, the development of modern automotive software systems is a formidable challenge. A well-known instrument for coping with the tremendous heterogeneity and complexity of modern automotive software systems is the use of architectural languages as a way of enabling different and specific views over these systems. However, the use of different architectural languages might come with the cost of reduced interoperability and automation as different languages might have weak to no integration. In this article, we tackle the challenge of integrating two architectural languages heavily used in the automotive domain for the design and timing analysis of automotive software systems: AMALTHEA and Rubus Component Model. The main contributions of this paper are (i) a mapping scheme for the translation of an AMALTHEA architecture into a Rubus Component Model architecture where high-precision timing analysis can be run, and the back annotation of the analysis results on the starting AMALTHEA architecture; (ii) the implementation of the proposed scheme, which uses the concept of model transformations for enabling a full-fledged automated integration; (iii) the application of such automation on three industrial automotive systems being the brake-by-wire, the full blown engine management system and the engine management system. We discuss and evaluate the proposed contributions using an online, experts survey and the above-mentioned use cases. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that the proposed automation mechanism is correct and applicable in industrial contexts. Besides, we observe that the performance of the automation mechanism does not degrade when translating large models with several thousands of elements. Eventually, we conclude that experts in this field find the proposed contribution industrially relevant.",0
A Collaborative Method for Identification and Selection of Data Sources in Market-driven requirements engineering,"Requirements engineering (RE) literature acknowledges the importance of early stakeholder identification. However, the challenge of identifying and selecting the right stakeholders and the potential of using other inanimate requirements sources for RE activities for market-driven products is not extensively addressed. Market-driven products are influenced by a large number of stakeholders. Consulting all stakeholders directly is impractical, and companies utilize indirect data sources, e.g. documents and representatives of larger groups of stakeholders. However, without a systematic approach, companies often use easy to access or hard to ignore data sources for RE activities. As a consequence, companies waste resources on collecting irrelevant data or develop the product based on the sub-optimal information sources that may lead to missing market opportunities. We propose a collaborative method to support identification and selection of the most relevant data sources for MDRE. The method consists of four steps and aims to build consensus between different perspectives in an organization and facilitates the identification of the most relevant data sources. We demonstrate the use of the method with two industrial case studies. Our results show that the method can support identification and selection of the most relevant data sources for MDRE in two ways: (1) by providing systematic steps to identify and prioritize data sources for RE, and (2) by highlighting and resolving discrepancies between different perspectives in an organization.",0
Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model for Embedded Systems,"Requirements engineering for embedded systems is challenging since they have unique properties that make it complex, expensive and error- prone as compared with other system categories, such as information systems. It is well known that organizations with high process maturity level reduce errors in system development. There are some requirements standards and maturity models. However, they are not complete and detailed enough to guide organiza- tions and practitioners in the Requirements Engineering for Embedded Systems. In this paper a maturity model is developed which can be used to assess the ma- turity of requirements engineering process for embedded systems. We propose an Embedded System Module, which consists of an enhancement of the Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity model (Uni-REPM). This module is based on international standards, a metamodel, and an extensive systematic liter- ature review. It will provide a quick assessment tool through which a company that develops embedded systems would be able to know what the strengths and weaknesses of their requirements are engineering process.",0
The role of simulation-based studies in software engineering research,"Several decades ago, inspired by other knowledge areas, simulation was introduced as a research method to Software Engineering. Motivated by potential benefits achieved in other areas, the software engineering community has used simulation-based studies for planning, controlling, and improving software development. However, unclear expectations from simulation-based studies, a lack of methodological support, as well as dispersed knowledge to support model building and calibration have hindered widespread adoption of simulation-based investigations. In this chapter, we delineate the role of simulation in software engineering research and compile processes and guidelines into a comprehensive life cycle. This chapter aims to guide software engineering researchers to conduct effective simulation-based studies in real-world settings.",0
Using Machine Intelligence to Prioritise Code Review Requests,"Modern Code Review (MCR) is the process of reviewing new code changes that need to be merged with an existing codebase. As a developer, one may receive many code review requests every day, i.e., the review requests need to be prioritised. Manually prioritising review requests is a challenging and time-consuming process. To address the above problem, we conducted an industrial case study at Ericsson aiming at developing a tool called Pineapple, which uses a Bayesian Network to prioritise code review requests. To validate our approach/tool, we deployed it in a live software development project at Ericsson, wherein more than 150 developers develop a telecommunication product. We focused on evaluating the predictive performance, feasibility, and usefulness of our approach. The results indicate that Pineapple has competent predictive performance (RMSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.15). Furthermore, around 82.6% of Pineapple's users believe the tool can support code review request prioritisation by providing reliable results, and around 56.5% of the users believeit helps reducing code review lead time. As future work, we planto evaluate Pineapple's predictive performance, usefulness, and feasibility through a longitudinal investigation.",0
A Method to Evaluate Knowledge Resources in Agile Software Development,"Background: Organizations adopting Agile Software Development (ASD) use different Knowledge Management (KM) practices to retain and share knowledge. However, it is often the case that knowledge retention is carried out in an ad-hoc way. Aims: In this study, we report our experience from proposing the Knowledge Critically Evaluation Method (KCEM) to evaluate knowledge items (KIT). Our main goal with KCEMs is to support companies to systematically retain knowledge in ASD contexts. Method: We conducted an improvement case study to develop and evaluate KCEM. This research follows the guidelines for technology transfer between industry and academia. The case and unit of analysis is Ericsson, a Swedish company that develops telecommunication solutions. Results: In this paper, we provide initial results of both lab and static validation, enriched by the lessons learned. Conclusions: The preliminary results show that KCEM is easy to understand and use, provides a different perspective on the KIT by visualizing in the criticality chart, and reduces the level of abstraction associated to a knowledge subject area.",0
Towards the Evaluation of the Usability and Portability of Serious Games,"Serious Games (SG) are designed to teach, train, or promote behavior change while entertaining players. They are increasingly popular because they provide significant health benefits, while improving the cognitive functions. Similarly, to other software tools, these solutions need to assess their quality, to be later improved. However, there are not contributions that allow the quality evaluation specifically related to the usability and portability characteristics. Therefore, this paper presents, first, an evaluation method aligned to the ISO/IEC 25040 standard, its activities, and artifacts which will be used for the serious game's quality evaluation. This method's name is Serious Game Quality Assessment Method (SG-QUAM).. Second, it provides a usability and portability model aligned to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and oriented to this specific domain (i.e., serious digital games), and lastly, the quality in use while players are using the application. Moreover, 16 software engineers evaluated the solution through an experiment; the results showed good insights oriented to improve the contributions and concluded that SG-QUAM is perceived as easy to use, useful and that could be used in the future.",0
Motivating the Contributions,"Relevant industry problem addressed with close academia-industry collaboration.First thorough of investigation of contribution strategies towards OSS ecosystems.A CAP model that support firms in contribution decisions and product planning.An information meta-model to support the operational use of the CAP model. Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firms practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems.",0
Status of Technology Transfer and Innovation in Ethiopia,"In the context of academic organizations, a technology transfer refers to the mechanism through which the institutions produce new technologies. Technology transfer may be accomplished in two ways: selling proprietary intellectual property to businesses or forming start-up firms. Universities, businesses, state and national economies and society as a whole prosper from successful technology transfer. Every institution, school, and university as a whole would benefit from the establishment of university industry links and a Technology Transfer Policy. It is critical to promote partnerships and strong collaboration between universities and industries that encourage realistic information development while also facilitating technology transfer. Students must be nurtured and equipped with realistic skills, which can only be accomplished by near collaboration and win-win agreements between universities and businesses in general. As a result, Ethiopia's educational system has placed a premium on university-industry linkages and technology transfer, resulting in the establishment of offices in all public universities throughout the region. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the success of technology transfer and innovation in western Oromia, Ethiopia. To determine the root cause of the issue, quality tools: Cause effect diagram and Parato diagram was used in this analysis. Mitigation techniques were designed to prevent recurrence of known poor performance areas (weaknesses), as well as a planning structure that traces the area's goals.",0
Towards a Methodology for Participant Selection in Software Engineering Experiments: A Vision of the Future,"Background. Software Engineering (SE) researchers extensively perform experiments with human subjects. Well-defined samples are required to ensure external validity. Samples are selected purposely or by convenience, limiting the generalizability of results. Objective. We aim to depict the current status of participants selection in empirical SE, identifying the main threats and how they are mitigated. We draft a robust approach to participants' selection. Method. We reviewed existing participants' selection guidelines in SE, and performed a preliminary literature review to find out how participants' selection is conducted in SE in practice. Results. We outline a new selection methodology, by 1) defining the characteristics of the desired population, 2) locating possible sources of sampling available for researchers, and 3) identifying and reducing the ""distance"" between the selected sample and its corresponding population. Conclusion. We propose a roadmap to develop and empirically validate the selection methodology.",0
Software product management,"Product planning is a core activity of a software product manager as described in the Software Product Management Framework. In this book, we differentiate the following processes: Roadmapping: the strategic and long-range planning of how a software product shall evolve. Product Requirements Engineering: the collection, analysis, and documentation of the software product?s requirements. Release Planning: the definition of the detailed contents and schedule of a forthcoming product release.",0
Team Discussions and Dynamics during DevOps Tool Adoptions in OSS Projects,"In Open Source Software (OSS) projects, pre-built tools dominate DevOps-oriented pipelines. In practice, a multitude of configuration management, cloud-based continuous integration, and automated deployment tools exist, and often more than one for each task. Tools are adopted (and given up) by OSS projects regularly. Prior work has shown that some tool adoptions are preceded by discussions, and that tool adoptions can result in benefits to the project. But important questions remain: how do teams decide to adopt a tool? What is discussed before the adoption and for how long? And, what team characteristics are determinant of the adoption?In this paper, we employ a large-scale empirical study in order to characterize the team discussions and to discern the teamlevel determinants of tool adoption into OSS projects' development pipelines. Guided by theories of team and individual motivations and dynamics, we perform exploratory data analyses, do deep-dive case studies, and develop regression models to learn the determinants of adoption and discussion length, and the direction of their effect on the adoption. From data of commit and comment traces of large-scale GitHub projects, our models find that prior exposure to a tool and member involvement are positively associated with the tool adoption, while longer discussions and the number of newer team members associate negatively. These results can provide guidance beyond the technical appropriateness for the timeliness of tool adoptions in diverse programmer teams.Our data and code is available at https://github.com/lkyin/tool_adoptions.",0
A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Practitioners' Use of Object-Oriented Concepts,"We present the first results from a survey carried out over the second quarter of 2009 examining how theories in object-oriented design are understood and used by software developers. We collected 3785 responses from software developers world-wide, which we believe is the largest survey of its kind. We targeted the use of encapsulation, class size as measured by number of methods, and depth of a class in the inheritance hierarchy. We found that, while overall practitioners followed advice on encapsulation, there was some variation of adherence to it. For class size and depth there was substantially less agreement with expert advice. In addition, inconsistencies were found within the use and perception of object-oriented concepts within the investigated group of developers. The results of this survey has deep reaching consequences for both practitioners and researchers as they highlight and confirm central issues.",0
Extraction of Test Cases Procedures from Textual Use Cases to Reduce Test Effort: Test Factory Experience Report,"The optimization of processes in the software development life cycle has become mandatory, since companies need to reduce the costs of their projects and shorten the time to market without affecting the quality of the product. With regards to software products, activities related to the testing process play a major role in their quality, since they assure that the product complies with the elicited requirements. However, companies usually do not perform testing activities on software projects due to financial and time constraints. These costs may be even higher in testing processes that rely on manual execution of activities, which is error-prone and can take too much time. To mitigate this situation, test automation allows the reduction of the effort required. This paper presents an experience report in a Test Factory about the use of a tool that partially automates the specification of test procedures based on use cases. The tool aims to read the textual use cases from the requirement management system, extract the test case procedures and required inputs to manual editing, and then send the test cases to the test management system. This solution is then applied to software from the telecommunications industry. This paper also presents how the tool was used and the lessons learned during the whole process.",0
Inner source software development: Current thinking and an agenda for future research,"Context Inner source software development (ISSD) has been viewed as an alternative approach in which organisations adopt open source software development (OSSD) practices and exploit its benefits internally. Objective In this paper, we aim to provide an extensive review of current research on ISSD and to establish a research agenda on this domain. Method The review is primarily performed using a systematic literature review protocol. Results We identified, critically evaluated and integrated the findings of 37 primary studies, describing 25 empirical research papers, 10 frameworks/methods, models and tools to support the implementation of inner source, as well as a set of benefits and challenges associated with ISSD. Conclusion This study presents four main contributions. First, the study provides an in-depth review of ISSD to date, i.e. the evolution of research across inner source, contributions of existing research developments, and theories, models and frameworks used to study inner source. Second, our review applies the OSSD approach framework as the lens to analyse ISSD. Third, the review updates the key challenges associated with ISSD from a management perspective. The final contribution is the establishment of a research agenda to advance knowledge on ISSD.",0
Self-Adaptation Driven by SysML and Goal Models--A Literature Review,"Context: Automated acceptance testing validates a product?s functionality from the customer?s perspective. Text-based automated acceptance tests (AATs) have gained popularity because they link requirements and testing. Objective: To propose and evaluate a cost-effective systematic reuse process for automated acceptance tests. Method: A systematic approach, method engineering, is used to construct a systematic reuse process for automated acceptance tests. The techniques to support searching, assessing, adapting the reusable tests are proposed and evaluated. The constructed process is evaluated using (i) qualitative feedback from software practitioners and (ii) a demonstration of the process in an industry setting. The process was evaluated for three constraints: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions. Results: The process consists of eleven activities that support development for reuse, development with reuse, and assessment of the costs and benefits of reuse. During the evaluation, practitioners found the process a useful method to support reuse. In the industrial demonstration, it was noted that the activities in the solution helped in developing an automated acceptance test with reuse faster than creating a test from scratch i.e., searching, assessment and adaptation parts. Conclusion: The process is found to be useful and relevant to the industry during the preliminary investigation.",0
Evaluation of a Stakeholder Satisfaction-oriented Method for Prioritising Change Requests,"The prioritisation of change requests for an evolving software is an important and complex activity in the continuous requirements engineering and release planning of an evolving product. We have explored such prioritisation with an organisation consisting of several business units appearing as stakeholders that compete for the same development resources. The challenge lay in taking objective factors like the cost-benefit ratio and technical dependencies of the requests into account while creating a high level of stakeholder satisfaction with the defined release scope. Together with the organisation, we have designed and implemented a tailored method that uses the stakeholders? satisfaction as a structured means for validating the criteria-based prioritisation results. The paper extends prior work by taking the perspective of the organisational stakeholders and describing the method design from the organisation?s perspective, reports the use of the method in the organisation, and summarises the lessons learned from using the method in the organisation. The results are useful to increase the maturity of prioritisation in industrialpractice.",0
Investigating probabilistic sampling approaches for large-scale surveys in software engineering,"Background Establishing representative samples for Software Engineering surveys is still considered a challenge. Specialized literature often presents limitations on interpreting surveys? results, mainly due to the use of sampling frames established by convenience and non-probabilistic criteria for sampling from them. In this sense, we argue that a strategy to support the systematic establishment of sampling frames from an adequate source of sampling can contribute to improve this scenario. Method A conceptual framework for supporting large scale sampling in Software Engineering surveys has been organized after performing a set of experiences on designing such strategies and gathering evidence regarding their benefits. The use of this conceptual framework based on a sampling strategy developed for supporting the replication of a survey on characteristics of agility and agile practices in software processes is depicted in this paper. Result A professional social network (Linkedln) was established as the source of sampling and its groups of interest as the units for searching members to be recruited. It allowed to deal with a sampling frame composed by more than 110,000 members (prospective subjects) distributed over 19 groups of interest. Then, through the similarity levels observed among these groups, eight strata were organized and 7745 members were invited, from which 291 have confirmed participation and answered the questionnaire. Conclusion The heterogeneity and number of participants in this replication contributed to improve the strength of original survey?s results. Therefore, we believe the sharing of this experience, the instruments and plan can be helpful for those researchers and practitioners interested on executing large scale surveys in Software Engineering.",0
The Challenges of Staying Together While Moving Fast: An Exploratory Study,"We report on the results of an empirical study conducted with 35 experienced software developers from 22 high-tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, and others. The goal of the study was to elicit challenges that these developers face, potential solutions that they envision to these challenges, and research initiatives that they think would deliver useful results. Challenges identified by the majority of the study participants relate to the collaborative nature of the work: the availability and discoverability of information, communication, collaborative planning and integration with work of others. Almost all participants also addressed the advantages and disadvantages of the current ?fast to the market? trend, and the toll it takes on the quality of the software that they are able to deliver and on their professional and personal satisfaction as software engineers. We describe in depth the identified challenges, supporting our findings with explicit quotes from the study participants. We also put these findings in context of work done by the software engineering community and outline a roadmap for possible future research initiatives.",0
Characterizing Sampling Frames in Software Engineering Surveys.,"Questionnaire-based Survey is a study strategy commonly applied in Software Engineering. It allows the researchers to perform descriptive large- scale investigations without the rigorous control level required by experiments. A critical issue on planning surveys concerns with the characterization of adequate sampling frames and their units of analysis. Therefore, this paper presents the results of a structured review in order to identify how sampling frames and units of analysis have been usually characterized in Software Engineering surveys. This investigation allowed to observe the predominant behavior of sampling by convenience whitin units of analysis composed by individuals retrieved from non-representative sources of sampling. Besides, it was also identified many other design alternatives. Based on these results , a set of recommendations on characterizing sampling frames for software engineering surveys, including the attributes gathered from each kind of unit of analysis (organization, individual, project), is presented aiming at supporting future surveys studies in software engineering.",0

A Retrospective Analysis of SAC Requirements: Engineering Track,"Context: The activities related to Requirements engineering (RE) are some of the most important steps in software development, since the requirements describe what will be provided in a software system in order to fulfill the stakeholders' needs. In this context, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary gathering forum for many RE activities. When studying a research area, it is important to identify the most active groups, topics, the research trends and so forth. Objective: In a previous paper, we investigated how the SAC RE-Track is evolving, by analyzing the papers published in its 8 previous editions. In this paper, we extended the analysis including the papers of the last edition (2016) and a brief resume of all papers published in the nine editions of SAC-RE track. Method: We adopted a research strategy that combines scoping study and systematic review good practices. Results: We investigated the most active countries, institutions and authors, the main topics discussed, the types of the contributions, the conferences and journals that have most referenced SAC RE-Track papers, the phases of the RE process supported by the contributions, the publications with the greatest impact, and the trends in RE. Conclusions: We found 86 papers over the 9 previous SAC RETrack editions, which were analyzed and discussed.",0
Redesigning a Postgraduate Software Engineering Module to Increase Engagement,"The COVID-19 pandemic required a complete transition to online teaching. With valid concerns of a potential decrease in student engagement, it was necessary to focus on the most effective learning strategies and reduce cognitive load. The software engineering professional practice postgraduate module at University College London uses flipped learning, providing resources prior to online discussions scheduled during normal lecture time. Questionnaires before topics establish student's level of knowledge and ensure well-understood concepts are not repeated. This allowed increased time for more challenging and engaging content. Industry guest speaker talks are integrated with academic lectures and provide alternative perspectives for each topic. Some industry speakers had less time during the current academic year to prepare videos so alternative ?fireside chats' (as occur in industry conferences) were employed to reduce speakers' preparation time. Analysis, across several measures indicates these changes to both academic and industry sessions have led to more than a 26% increase in student engagement. Whilst this required a substantial increase in workload for lecturers much of this development work can be utilized again in the future. The current module design also gives both academic and industry speakers a greater range of options in delivering their content.",0
Accelerating microbiota product development: The Societal Impact Value Cycle as a conceptual model to shape and improve public-private valorization processes,"Despite their potential for preventing and reducing diseases, the availability of marketed probiotics with a relevant health or risk reduction claim is lagging behind. Food and pharmaceutical companies, as well as universities, are challenged to collaborate across the innovation value chain to deliver on the promises of microbiota research and development. A shared understanding of the knowledge valorization process is essential for the success of such public-private partnerships. Conceptual models enable stakeholders to discuss and understand complex processes and their corresponding activities but current models are lacking granularity in terms of activities taking place. Building upon the microbiota valorization and technology transfer cycle, this review synthesizes 32 conceptual models on knowledge valorization into a Societal Impact Value Cycle that describes relevant activities. The cycle is contextualized to the microbiota industry and 8 key points for successful innovation are highlighted. The model elucidates the importance of including unmet needs in wider society for generating socioeconomic benefits. While market and society domains contained the highest number of barriers in the probiotics industry, they were scarcely covered by the reviewed literature, highlighting their underexposure. The resulting generally applicable model aids stakeholders in outlining a thorough strategy to deliver really new and radical innovations.",0
A comprehensive software project management framework,"Project management is vital for software project success. Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV), and other software project management models and practices established to assist software organizations, each of these models offers diverse focal points. Combined effective software project management practices remain a challenge to software organizations. In striving to raise the likelihood of software project success, this paper introduces a framework for software project management effectiveness which integrated a set of software project management practices based on the PMBOK guide processes, CMMI-DEV processes, and management areas that influence a software project. The proposed framework called 4PTRB which includes people, process, product, project, technology, risk, and business management areas. The 4PTRB software project management framework provides a whole comprehensive view to help software project managers to improve their project management effectiveness. The framework is validated by conducting a web-based survey of software professional practitioners around the world. A statistical analysis of twenty software projects has been conducted as a case study thereafter, spanning small to large development projects. The consistency of the case study and survey results shows the power of the 4PTRB framework as an inclusive software project management framework.",0
Adaboost-multilayer perceptron to predict the student?s performance in software engineering,"Software Engineering (SE) course is one of the backbones of today's computer technology sophistication. Effective theoretical and practical learning of this course is essential to computer students. However, there are many students fail in this course. There are many aspects that influence a student's performance. Currently, student performance analysis methods just focus on historical achievement and assessment methods given in the class. Need more research to predict student's performance to overcome the problem of student failing. The objective of this research is to perform a prediction for student's performance in the SE using enhanced Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning classification with Adaboost. This research also investigates the requirements of each student before registering in this course. This research achieved 87.76 percent accuracy in classifying the performance of SE students.",0
Open meta-modelling frameworks via meta-object protocols,"Meta-modelling is central to Model-Driven Engineering. Many meta-modelling notations, approaches and tools have been proposed along the years, which widely vary regarding their supported modelling features. However, current approaches tend to be closed and rigid with respect to the supported concepts and semantics. Moreover, extending the environment with features beyond those natively supported requires highly technical knowledge. This situation hampers flexibility and interoperability of meta-modelling environments. In order to alleviate this situation, we propose open meta-modelling frameworks, which can be extended and configured via meta-object protocols (MOPs). Such environments offer extension points on events like element instantiation, model loading or property access, and enable selecting particular model elements over which the extensions are to be executed. We show how MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and allow describing a wide range of meta-modelling concepts. As a proof of concept, we show and compare an implementation in the MetaDepth tool and an aspect-based implementation atop the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF). We have evaluated our approach by extending EMF and MetaDepth with modelling services not foreseen initially when they were created. The evaluation shows that MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and are powerful enough to support the specification of a broad variety of meta-modelling features.",0
A Systematic Mapping Study on DSL Evolution,"Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are frequently used in software engineering. In contrast to general-purpose languages, DSLs are designed for a special purpose in a particular domain. Due to volatile user requirements and new technologies DSLs, similar to the software systems they describe or produce, are subject to continuous evolution. This work explores existing research on DSL evolution to summarize, structure and analyze this area of research, and to identify trends and open issues. We conducted a systematic mapping study and identified 98 papers as potentially relevant for our study. By applying inclusion and exclusion criteria we selected a set of 34 papers relevant for DSL evolution. We classified and analyzed these papers to create a map of the research field. We conclude that DSL evolution is a topic of increasing relevancy. However, research on language evolution so far did not focus much on the characteristics DSLs exhibit. Also, there are not many cross-references between our primary studies meaning researchers are often not aware of potentially useful work. Our study results help researchers and practitioners working on DSL-based approaches to get an overview of existing research on DSL evolution and open challenges.",0
On the complex nature of MDE evolution and its impact on changeability,"In model-driven engineering (MDE), a particular MDE setting of employed languages and automated and manual activities has major impact on productivity. Furthermore, it has been observed that such MDE settings evolve over time. However, currently not much is known about this evolution and its impact on the MDE setting?s maturity, i.e., on changeability and other productivity dimensions. Research so far focuses on evolution of separate building blocks, such as (modeling-) languages, tools, or transformation, only. In this article, we address the lack of knowledge about evolution of MDE settings by investigating case studies from different companies. The first results reveal (1) that there is evolution that affects the composition of an MDE setting (structural evolution) and has the potential to strongly impact aspects, such as changeability and (2) that this structural evolution actually occurs in practice. Based on these first results, we investigated (3) whether there are cases in practice, where structural evolution already altered the risks of changeability given by the respective MDE setting. Therefore, we search and identify examples for such evolution steps on MDE settings from practice and collected six case studies on evolution histories in detail. As a result, we show in this paper that structural evolution (a) is not seldom in practice and (b) sometimes leads to the introduction of changeability risks.",0
Structural equation model of technology transfer from non-profit organisations to community product entrepreneurs,"The goal of this study is to create equation models of technology transfer from non-profit organisations to community product entrepreneurs, using 462 transferee sample questionnaires. According to the findings, the transfer environment had no direct influence on the transferee's learning capacity as a mediator, but it did have a direct influence on the efficacy of technology transfer. The characteristics of the transferor and transferee had a direct impact on the efficacy of technology transfer. Transferor characteristics had no direct influence on the efficacy of technology transfer, but did have an indirect influence on the efficacy of technology transfer using the transferee's learning capacity as a mediator. Furthermore, transferee characteristics had a direct impact on the efficacy of technology transfer. The study's recommendations serve as a guideline for executives in developing relevant policies and strategies for the development technology transfer systems. It will aid the transferee's preparation prior to the technology transfer. This will be useful in technology transfer.",0
Towards a lightweight approach for the evaluation of requirements engineering impact on other IT project areas,"Requirements Engineering (RE) is recognized as one of the most important, but difficult areas of software engineering, with a significant impact on other areas of the IT project and its final outcome. The empirical studies investigating this impact are hard to conduct, mainly due to large effort required. It is thus difficult for researchers and even more for industry practitioners to make evidence-based evaluations, how decisions about RE (e.g. RE process improvements, RE techniques selection) translate into requirements quality and influence other project areas. We propose an idea of a lightweight approach, utilizing the popular tools adopted by numerous software companies, to enable such evaluation without an excessive effort. The proposal is illustrated with a pilot study, where the data from 6 industrial projects from a single organization was analyzed and 3 metrics regarding requirements quality, rework effort and testing were used to demonstrate the impact of different RE techniques applied among considered projects. We also discuss the factors important to enabling adoption of the proposed approach.",0
Assisted requirements selection by clustering,"Requirements selection is a decision-making process that enables project managers to focus on the deliverables that add most value to the project outcome. This task is performed to define which features or requirements will be developed in the next release. It is a complex multi-criteria decision process that has been focused by many research works, because a balance between business profits and investment is needed. The spectrum of prioritization techniques spans from simple and qualitative to elaborated analytic prioritization approaches that fall into the category of optimization algorithms. This work studies the combination of the qualitative MoSCoW method and cluster analysis for requirements selection. The feasibility of our methodology has been tested on three case studies (with 20, 50 and 100 requirements). In each of them, the requirements have been clustered, and then the clustering configurations found have been evaluated using internal validation measures for the compactness, connectivity and separability of the clusters. The experimental results show the validity of clustering strategies for the identification of the core set of requirements for the software product, being the number of categories proposed by MoSCoW a good starting point in requirements prioritization and negotiation.",0
"variED: an editor for collaborative, real-time feature modeling","Feature models are a helpful means to document, manage, maintain, and configure the variability of a software system, and thus are a core artifact in software product-line engineering. Due to the various purposes of feature models, they can be a cross-cutting concern in an organization, integrating technical and business aspects. For this reason, various stakeholders (e.g., developers and consultants) may get involved into modeling the features of a software product line. Currently, collaboration in such a scenario can only be done with face-to-face meetings or by combining single-user feature-model editors with additional communication and version-control systems. While face-to-face meetings are often costly and impractical, using version-control systems can cause merge conflicts and inconsistency within a model, due to the different intentions of the involved stakeholders. Advanced tools that solve these problems by enabling collaborative, real-time feature modeling, analogous to Google Docs or Overleaf for text editing, are missing. In this article, we build on a previous paper and describe (1) the extended formal foundations of collaborative, real-time feature modeling, (2) our conflict resolution algorithm in more detail, (3) proofs that our formalization converges and preserves causality as well as user intentions, (4) the implementation of our prototype, and (5) the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the prototype?s usability. Our contributions provide the basis for advancing existing feature-modeling tools and practices to support collaborative feature modeling. The results of our evaluation show that our prototype is considered helpful and valuable by 17 users, also indicating potential for extending our tool and opportunities for new research directions.",0
A scrum-centric framework for organizing software engineering academic courses,"Teaching Scrum and other complex Software Engineering (SE) practices, methods, and tools within a regular academic course is often a challenging task because the examples shown to students and their working environment are not realistic enough. This problem is frequently tackled by organizing courses in the form of capstone projects. Unfortunately, this approach requires additional resources (e.g., more tutors, external customers, etc.) what limits the potential number of participants. As a response to this problem, we propose a Scrum-centric framework that allows combining lectures and laboratory classes with a minimalistic capstone project, all within a regular SE course. The course is organized similarly to a project run according to the Scrum guidelines. The focal point of the framework is the synchronization between the content presented during lectures and laboratory classes with the capstone project iterations (sprints). We also share our experience from 2 years of conducting Software Engineering course organized according to the framework together with the results of a cross-sectional survey assessing student perceptions of the effectiveness of the approach.",0
Decision architect â€“ A decision documentation tool for industry,"Architecture decisions are often not explicitly documented in practice, even though explicit capturing and documentation of architecture decisions has been associated with a multitude of benefits. Several decision documentation tools have been proposed but they often do not meet the expectations and needs of the industry. As part of a research collaboration with ABB, we developed a decision documentation tool that aims to ensure industrial applicability. This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate the add-in, we conducted a case study with architects from ABB. In this study, we assessed to what extent and why software architects intend to use our approach. We therefore investigated the perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and contextual factors threat influence the architectâ€™s intention to use the tool. We found that the tool has a high relevance for software architects, that it increases the quality of decision documentation and that it improves productivity of architects in various ways. With respect to ease-of-use, the study identified the need for better guidelines. With respect to contextual factors, we found several factors that influence the intention to use the add-in in an industrial environment.",0
Software quality research: From processes to model-based techniques,"In this article we state that cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things pose challenges to software quality research. In the emerging real-time digital economy companies need to gain deep customer insight. The state of the art in modelbased systems and model-based testing allows software engineers for product-based and quantitative control of quality and for increased productivity. These gains can be invested to better understand the domain and business conditions. We argue that cyber-physical systems will pose an excellent basis for conducting collaborative research in model-based systems and model-based testing in the near future and report on lessons learnt in three areas of software (quality) research: (1) process-oriented quality, (2) model-based systems and (3) model-based testing.",0
DRR technology sharing and transfer through web-based platforms: Lessons learned from Korean studies,"Purpose Disaster risk reduction (DRR) technology sharing has emerged as an important global issue across national boundaries. As a result, the DRR technology-sharing environment needs strengthening based on the findings of difficulties in sharing, investment, and commitment. The purpose of this paper is to three fold: first, it will clarify that a web-based platform is the best conduit for linking DRR technology from the supplier to the beneficiary developing countries. Second, it will find the most evolutionary path based on Korean case studies. Finally, it will make recommendations for the efficient implementation of a web-based platform for DRR technology sharing. Design/methodology/approach This paper posits that DRR technology sharing is a necessary part of enhancing resilience to disasters in the Asia-Pacific region. The evolution of web-based approaches (a merchandise display-type platform, a journal-type platform, an electronic market-type platform, and an architecture and governance-type platform) and an actual case of space technology sharing providing support for an evolution toward community-based technology sharing in DRR. The research will find the most efficient way going forward based on the case study of a four-year R & D project sponsored by the South Korean Government. It will also find the success factors for the way to establish and operate the platform efficiently and effectively through case studies of the four types of web-based platforms. Findings Sharing of DRR technology through a web-based platform among Asia-Pacific countries is necessary in order to equip all parties with essential technology to mitigate intensifying disasters, to overcome the barriers of technology sharing, to breakdown transfer issues due to language barriers, and to strengthen insufficient DRR budgets. Among the four types of web-based platforms, the architecture and governance-type platform proved to be the most effective and efficient. In addition, four principles for an efficient implementation are identified through case studies, analysis, and research. Originality/value This paper reports on the reasons why it is difficult for DRR technology sharing in the Asia and Pacific regions and suggests a web-based DRR technology-sharing platform as a solution for the region. Moreover, it substantiates that the architecture and governance platform type as the most efficient and effective evolution with four principles: develop based on end-user?s needs; take a problem-solving approach; contain interactive communication tools; and provide business opportunity.",0

APPLICATION OF THE TOPSIS METHOD FOR PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFER OPTIONS.,"In modern times, the business success of enterprises is increasingly the result of the development of science and the accelerated introduction of new advances. Innovations is becoming the key to success. Under these conditions, the importance of technology transfer is also becoming a main ""strategic way of meeting the challenges of globalization in business"" (Mayer and Blaas, 2002). With the increasing importance of technological transfer, increases the interest in the theoretical elucidation and empirical research of various aspects of its implementation in enterprises.In view of the above, the aim of this paper is to propose a method for the preliminary assessment of alternative technology transfer options based on the use of the TOPSIS method (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) (Hwang and Yoon, 1981). It allows an initial assessment and selection of technological transfer options on the base of preliminary selected important criteria. As a result, businesses can reduce the number of options that will later be subject to a more in-depth assessment, from the list of already selected ones, by choosing only those who have good potential and are in their capabilities. In this way the experts? efforts are focused and their work, concerning the selection of a transfer option in which to invest, is also significantly relieved.",0
TASKS AND CHALLENGES IN PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT WITH NOVEL TECHNOLOGY--AN EMPIRICAL STUDY,"This paper presents a thematic analysis of 138 monthly reports from a joint industrial and academic project where multiple prototypes were developed based on the same technology. The analysis was based on tasks and challenges described in the reports by project managers over a period of three years. 17 task themes and 9 challenge themes were identified. It was found that test, implementation, and project management were prominent tasks. Familiarization with the technology was found to a very little degree, which was in opposition to literature. The main challenge was found to be system development. It was found that the predominant tasks and challenges are distributed over long periods of time, rather than in chunks linked to a specific development phase.",0
Transfer and Commercialization of Technologies from Universities to Small Companies in South Africa,"World-wide many universities have a significant role in the socio-economic development of their countries and regions. One avenue for universities to achieve this role is through the transfer and commercialization of their technologies to resource-constrained small, medium enterprises (SMEs). A survey-based study was conducted to establish the factors that enable and restrain the transfer and commercialization of technology from South African publicly-funded universities (transferor) to SMEs (transferee), as well as to recommend how the restraining factors could be addressed. The sample consisted of researchers and technology managers drawn from entrepreneurs and six Gauteng universities. Respondents rated each of the ten literature-derived enabling factors and ten literature- derived restraining factors to technology transfer and commercialization from universities to SMEs. Results show the top two enabling factors to be absorptive capacity of the transferee; and transferor's attitude towards TT and commercialization. The top two restraining factors are university bureaucracy and the university performance evaluation system. Measures to deal with the top four restraining factors are suggested and useful insights are provided by the research findings.",0
STUDY OF THE DETERMINANTS OF THE ENTERPRISE'S CAPACITY TO ABSORB NEW TECHNOLOGIES.,"In modern times the business success of enterprises is more and more th? result of the development of science and the accelerated introduction of new advances in technology. Innovations are becoming the key to success. In these conditions the importance of technological transfer also grows and it becomes a main ?strategic way of meeting the challenges of globalization in business? (Mayer and Blaas, 2002). With the growth in importance of the transfer of technologies increases the interest in the theoretical elucidation and empirical research of various aspects of the absorption capacity of enterprises and its determinants, characterizing the capability for timely recognition, acquisition and use of new advances.In view of the above, the aim of this paper is to present, in brief, an opinion on the determinants of the absorption capacity of enterprises and the factors that affect the formation of the them as well as the findings of empirical research of their state and impact on the intensity of technological transfer, innovative activity and business results of industrial enterprises in Bulgaria.",0
Exploring capabilities of international technology transfer intermediaries between emerging and developed countries,"We report which capabilities are essential to a successful demand-driven inter-organizational international technology transfer (ITT) when a business deal involves an emerging country recipient and a developed country source. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study collected opinions from 74 experts from 12 countries on technology transfer and diffusion, innovation systems and networks, and knowledge-intensive business services. In a preliminary attempt to identify which skills are critical, we present the perspective of emerging countries? stakeholders. The suggested 28 critical capabilities can be used as an input for further empirical analysis. The conceptual framework can be applied to assess an intermediary?s performance for a given ITT project in which the demand arises from an emerging-country stakeholder.",0
A structured approach to academic technology transfer: lessons learned from imec's 101 programme,"In this article, we describe imec?s 101 Programme for academic technology transfer and explain how it supports researchers by following a structured process in a limited amount of time and by carefully involving different stakeholders and people with relev- ant skills and expertise. The programme combines insights in terms of processes and of team composition from the entrepreneurship literature and puts them into practice in an internal incubation programme that is generated from the bottom-up. Based on hands-on experiences and interviews with key stakeholders in the process, we evaluate the programme and distill lessons learned. The article highlights the importance of a structured technology transfer process in the early stages of opportunity discovery and entrepreneurial action, and it offers insights on team formation for academic spin-offs.",0
Extraction of protein-protein interactions using natural language processing based pattern matching,"A significant part of our knowledge is relationships between two terms. However, most of these information is documented as unstructured text in various forms, like books, online articles and webpages. Extract those information and store them in a structured database could help people utilize these information more conveniently. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to extract the relationships information based on Nature Language Processing (NLP) and graph theoretic algorithm. Our method, Grammatical Relationship Graph for Triplets (GRGT), extracts three layers of information: the pairs of terms that have certain relationship, exactly what type of the relationship is, and what direct this relationship is. GRGT works on a grammatical graph obtained by parsed the sentence using Natural Language Processing. Patterns were extracted from the graph by shortest path among the words of interests. We have designed a decision tree to make the pattern matching. GRGT was applied to extract the protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) from biomedical literature, and obtained better precision than the best performing method in literature. Beyond extracting PPIs, our method could be easily extended to extracting relationship information between other bio-entities.",0
SEE_ME: Software Engineering Education Methodology Exploration,"Software Engineering is a primary subject in many computer science departments of universities worldwide. Its purpose is to help students understand and apply both disciplined and systematic methods to software development. Due to the ubiquity and visibility of software in the modern world, the study, education and research into software engineering and its practice have retained a high level of interest. Distinct in nature from other computer science courses, this discipline borrows from and is influenced by other fields such as, systems analysis, design, management, quality control, and communication. In this paper, the practices and methodologies used, developed, and evaluated in the Software Engineering Education (SEE) will be outlined. Further improvements have been planned through the Software Engineering Education Methodology Exploration (SEE_ME) project.",0
Project-Based Learning with Examples from Industry in University Courses: An Experience Report from an Undergraduate Requirements Engineering Course,"A significant challenge within university education, especially with regard to the teaching of highly theoretical topics like requirements engineering, is to maintain students' interest and motivation whilst addressing the core concepts that will enable students to work in industry upon graduation. It has long been established that experience-based learning can aid in both these feats: On the one hand, providing students with industrial case examples rather than ""dry"" academic assignments can increase student interest and motivation. On the other hand, a case example-centric classroom approach can yield a rich learning environment which fosters collaboration, communication, and self-directed exploration of the instructed principles. In previous work, we have reported on our experience in changing a graduate requirements engineering course towards using case examples based on real industry projects. As more and more curricula change in advance of project-based teaching paradigms, this paper discusses results from the long-term application of such a course design in a graduate setting. In addition, this paper reports our findings from the replication in an undergraduate requirements engineering course indicating that project-based learning techniques foster different teaching goals in graduate and undergraduate settings.",0
Team Composition in Software Engineering Project Courses,"Composing well-balanced, effective development teams for software engineering project courses is important for facilitating learning, fostering student motivation as well as obtaining a successful project outcome. However, team composition is a challenging task for instructors because they have to consider a variety of possibly conflicting criteria such as practical constraints, skill distribution, or project motivation. In this paper, we describe our process for composing development teams based on a pre-defined set of criteria that we have established from our experience conducting project courses since 2008 and constantly refined since. We reflect on these criteria by analyzing the team synergy and project satisfaction of participating students as well as their perspective on challenges in their teams in one concrete instance of a multi-project capstone course. Our findings show that lack of motivation, problems with interpersonal relationships and communication issues affect the less satisfied teams more than the others.",0
Design and simulation of Perturb and observe Maximum Power Point Tracking in MATLAB and Simulink,"This paper presents the modeling of Photo Voltaic (PV) module using the two different approach using MATLAB/Simulink. The modeling is based on the two diode model of solar cell. Two approaches are used to simulate the PV module, the first is based on the available Simulink library of simscape/simelectronics and second is based on the simulation PV cell current and voltage equations in Simulink environment. The current-voltage (I-V) and Power-Voltage (P-V) characteristics of PV module and significance of each approach is discussed. The inherent nonlinear nature of characteristics is observed. The effect of change in the temperature, sun radiation on the P-V characteristics is observed. The change in Maximum Power Point (MPP) is observed by changing the sun radiation, temperature and other solar cell parameters such as series and shunt resistance. The graphical user interface of system enables any one to analyze the operation of PV module under different environmental conditions and manufacturing specifications. The designed models of PV module could work here as simulator. This work can find its use in implementation of different Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods, in which the PV module modelling is necessary. The proposed models can be easily interfaced with the power converter models for designing of entire PV systems. Also the parameters like fill factor and characteristic resistance which are useful for MPPT designing are estimated under varying climate conditions.",0
Involving External Stakeholders in Project Courses,"Problem: The involvement of external stakeholders in capstone projects and project courses is desirable due to its potential positive effects on the students. Capstone projects particularly profit from the inclusion of an industrial partner to make the project relevant and help students acquire professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is aligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed. However, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can create friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all involved parties.Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a retrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a constructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders.Key Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised of several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The guideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical objectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify issues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other groups involved in the courses.Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively to a total of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto implicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the interaction between external stakeholders and students. Our empirical data reveals seven recurring risk themes that categorise the different risks appearing in the analysed courses. These themes can also be used to categorise mitigation strategies to address these risks proactively. Additionally, aspects not related to external stakeholders, e.g., about the interaction of the project with other courses in the study programme, have been revealed. The constructive use of the model for one course has proved helpful in identifying action alternatives and finally deciding to not include external stakeholders in the project due to the perceived cost-benefit-ratio.Implications to Practice: Our evaluation shows that the model is a viable and useful tool that allows teachers to reason about and plan the involvement of external stakeholders in a variety of course settings, and in particular in capstone projects.",0
Teaching software engineering through comics and micro-movie design projects,"A new approach based on comics and designing micro-movies is proposed for software engineering education. Comics are used to help students capture the key issues quickly and effectively. The process of making micro-movies provides a context for students to simulate the challenges happened in the real world. The experiment for the new teaching approach has been conducted. The preliminary results are positive. Furthermore, the learning experience is joyful when compared with the other courses.",0
Participating in an Industry Based Social Service Program: a Report of Student Perception of What They Learn and What They Need,"Skills demanded by the IT industry from graduates should be aligned with the curricula of Computer Science undergraduate programs. It is well-known that theoretical knowledge undergraduate students acquire during their studies needs to be complemented with practical experience; therefore, participating in university supported real life projects is a viable option for the students to get prepared for the industry. This paper reports findings from a survey applied to students who had been involved in an industry-based program meant to fulfill their graduation requirements, including the opportunity to develop a capstone project. We gathered their perceptions regarding what they learned during their studies, what they acquired in the industry-based program and what they consider useful for their current jobs. The results show that most topics are aligned between the Bachelor's degree program and the industry needs, but there is a strong separation in the cognitive levels students achieve at each stage. The paper provides insight into the needs of Computer Science students and contributes to finding ways of increasing undergraduate student satisfaction with skills acquired at university and their application in real contexts.",0
A Syllabus for Usability Engineering in Multi-Project Courses.,"Usability engineering is an important activity in to- day?s application development, which raises the need to focus on its teaching efforts. However, in contrast to theoretical concepts, learning usability engineering is most successful in a hands-on environment. Fur- thermore, a challenge exists in efficiently applying usability assessment techniques to carry out usability engineering over time. We developed the UE4MP syl- labus, a four meeting-based teaching approach for ag- ile multi-project courses using cross-functional teams. The syllabus enables students to gain usability engi- neering knowledge and experience through hands-on learning and to make use of a platform for usability engineering. The overall goal is to relate usability concepts closely to applications that are developed by the students themselves. We applied the UE4MP syllabus over the course of one semester and report on our observations and challenges.",0
Industry projects in requirements engineering education: Application in a university course in the US and comparison with Germany,"Project-based learning has proven useful in software engineering education to increase student engagement and learning performance. In this paper, we contribute our experiences from applying industry projects in an undergraduate requirements engineering course in the United States. We furthermore discuss our experiences from courses conducted in Germany and the US course in light of difference in the educational systems. Results show that our course design is well received in both countries in terms of learning outcomes, student motivation, teamwork, attention to detail, and performance in the exam.",0
Critical Issues in Requirements Engineering Education,"Requirements Engineering (RE) is the most crucial process within software development projects. In order to prepare skilled requirements engineers, Requirements Engineering Education (REE) needs to be provided to students at the university level before they become software engineers and part of the workforce. However, RE is considered the most difficult subject within the software engineering curriculum for students to learn and for lecturers to teach due to its uncertain nature. This chapter examines the current and potential areas for research within REE. It first presents the current status of REE provided in universities and the REE problems reported in the literature that lead us to the potential research problems in REE. The REE teaching approaches proposed by researchers are then elaborated. The proposed approaches are mapped back to address the REE problems. The chapter closes with recommended directions for future REE research.",0
Reaching Steady State in Software Engineering Project Courses.,"Project courses provide students with a hands-on experience of software engineering practices in industry and prepare them for their later career. The first weeks of such a course typically involve change and uncertainty and are therefore challenging for students: project teams have to understand requirements that are often unclear, learn to work together and communicate as a team, as well as become accustomed to processes and workflows used in the course. In this paper, we summarize our experiences of how student teams master change at the beginning of a project course to reach a steady state in which the level of uncertainty is manageable. We describe the typical stages of a student project, go into detail on the challenges during the Launch Phase and provide suggestions of how instructors can help students overcome those challenges. We report both on our experience conducting project courses with clients from industry since 2008 and on the results of a qualitative evaluation of one instance of a large multi-project capstone course.",0
Final Year Students' Approaches to Implementing Complex Distributed Systems,"Understanding how final year students build complex software systems is critical for determining whether desired graduate outcomes have been met, for identifying curriculum gaps, and for designing scaffolding and support structures. A large body of work focuses on the programming strategies employed by novice programmers, with few existing research in understanding programming strategies and development focus of final year students, in particular with respect to non-functional requirements. In this paper, we analyse consecutive revisions of 77 students across two cohorts that implemented a large and complex Distributed Systems assignment with several non-functional requirements. To obtain a qualitative overview of the students' approach to software development, we manually read and tagged all sourcefiles in all assignment revisions with specific development focus categories. Our analysis identifies how the students' development focus evolves throughout the assignment timeline. We visualise the software development process and identify several areas that require further support.",0
Teaching Research Methodologies with a Robot in a CS Lab Course,"
We describe a computer science lab course that teaches a scientific research methodology. Our course is based on a recent research project and augments it with a motivating goal: We program a robot based on the Lego EV3 brick with plain English. Our students developed a multi-module solution; all modules were planned, implemented, and benchmarked following a research life cycle.

The results of our case study indicate that a lab course can familiarize students with academic research methodologies. Interviews with the participants, conducted half a year after the lab course, confirm our positive impressions: Our participants indeed internalized the research life cycle and all told us that they wanted to pursue research in their upcoming curriculum. Three of four stated that the possibility to monitor progress by running solutions on the robot was highly motivating.

Results show that our course design is well received in both countries in terms of learning outcomes, student motivation, teamwork, attention to detail, and performance in the exam.",0
Using a case study to teach students about finding and fixing logic flaws in software,"An application logic flaw is a type of software vulnerability related to privilege manipulation or transaction control manipulation. They are often difficult to identify using automated scanners. A case study on the eCommerce merchant software Bigcommerce, integrated with PayPal Express as a third party payment collector, was created to teach students about this topic. Case studies provide students with a real-world context, and help them understand complex topics better than traditional teaching methods. However, the computer science field, especially computer security, does not have many case studies available. The case study on logic flaws in software was taught in Spring 2015, and the teaching experience is discussed.",0
A Step Towards Introducing Data Analytics and Visualization for Students of Electrical Sciences: An Initiative Through Machine Learning Course,"In this paper, we share our experience of introducing data analytics and visualization for students of electrical sciences through Machine Learning course. Typically, electrical science students face challenges in handling and visualizing huge data and its analysis as there is a limited scope in the curriculum. During the discussion with research and development centers of different industries and institutes we found the gap in curriculum, and towards this, we designed the Machine Learning course to introduce data analytics and visualization, and state of art machine learning tool for students of electrical sciences. The course is designed with different levels of exercises and activities to support their learning. Exercises were designed to support conceptual learning and were extended as activities towards solving a given problem. The course project was designed as an extended activity considering problems from online challenges and contests/ hackathon towards enhancing their learning beyond the curriculum. The outcome of the course was motivating as industry people appreciated the learning through evaluation.",0
A Dissection of the Test-Driven Development Process: Does It Really Matter to Test-First or to Test-Last?,"Background: Test-driven development (TDD) is a technique that repeats short coding cycles interleaved with testing. The developer first writes a unit test for the desired functionality, followed by the necessary production code, and refactors the code. Many empirical studies neglect unique process characteristics related to TDD iterative nature. Aim: We formulate four process characteristic: sequencing, granularity, uniformity, and refactoring effort. We investigate how these characteristics impact quality and productivity in TDD and related variations. Method: We analyzed 82 data points collected from 39 professionals, each capturing the process used while performing a specific development task. We built regression models to assess the impact of process characteristics on quality and productivity. Quality was measured by functional correctness. Result: Quality and productivity improvements were primarily positively associated with the granularity and uniformity. Sequencing, the order in which test and production code are written, had no important influence. Refactoring effort was negatively associated with both outcomes. We explain the unexpected negative correlation with quality by possible prevalence of mixed refactoring. Conclusion: The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to its distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact that TDD-like processes encourage fine-grained, steady steps that improve focus and flow.",0
Towards an operationalization of test-driven development skills: An industrial empirical study,"Context: The majority of the empirical studies on Test-driven development (TDD) are concerned with verifying or refuting the effectiveness of the technique over a traditional approach, and they tend to neglect whether the subjects possess the necessary skills to apply TDD, though they argue such skills are necessary. Objective: We evaluate a set of minimal, a priori and in process skills necessary to apply TDD. We determine whether variations in external quality (i.e., number of defects) and productivity (i.e., number of features implemented) can be associated with different clusters of the TDD skillsâ€™ set. Method: We executed a quasi-experiment involving 30 practitioners from industry. We first grouped the participants according to their TDD skillsâ€™ set (consisting of a priori experience on programming and testing as well as in-process TDD conformance) into three levels (Low-Medium-High) using k-means clustering. We then applied ANOVA to compare the clusters in terms of external quality and productivity, and conducted post-hoc pairwise analysis. Results: We did not observe a statistically significant difference between the clusters either for external software quality (F(2,27=1.44,p=.260), or productivity (F(2,27)=3.02,p=.065). However, the analysis of the effect sizes and their confidence intervals shows that the TDD skillsâ€™ set is a factor that could account for up to 28% of the external quality, and 38% for productivity. Conclusion: We have reason to conclude that focusing on the improvement of TDD skillsâ€™ set investigated in this study could benefit software developers in improving their baseline productivity and the external quality of the code they produce. However, replications are needed to overcome the issues related with the statistical power of this study. We suggest practical insights for future work to investigate the phenomenon further.",0
On the Effectiveness of Unit Tests in Test-Driven Development,"Background: Writing unit tests is one of the primary activities in test-driven development. Yet, the existing reviews report few evidence supporting or refuting the effect of this development approach on test case quality. Lack of ability and skills of developers to produce sufficiently good test cases are also reported as limitations of applying test-driven development in industrial practice. Objective: We investigate the impact of test-driven development on the effectiveness of unit test cases compared to an incremental test last development in an industrial context. Method: We conducted an experiment in an industrial setting with 24 professionals. Professionals followed the two development approaches to implement the tasks. We measure unit test effectiveness in terms of mutation score. We also measure branch and method coverage of test suites to compare our results with the literature. Results: In terms of mutation score, we have found that the test cases written for a test-driven development task have a higher defect detection ability than test cases written for an incremental test-last development task. Subjects wrote test cases that cover more branches on a test-driven development task compared to the other task. However, test cases written for an incremental test-last development task cover more methods than those written for the second task. Conclusion: Our findings are different from previous studies conducted at academic settings. Professionals were able to perform more effective unit testing with test-driven development. Furthermore, we observe that the coverage measure preferred in academic studies reveal different aspects of a development approach. Our results need to be validated in larger industrial contexts.",0
A supervised approach for automatic web documents topic extraction using well-known web design features,"The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient method for identification of web document topics which is often considered as one of the debatable challenges in many information retrieval systems. Most of the previous works have focused on analyzing the entire text using time-consuming methods and also many of them have used unsupervised approaches to identify the main topic of documents. However, in this paper, it is attempted to exploit the most widely-used Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) features to extract topics from web documents using a supervised approach. Hiring an interactive crawler, we firstly try to analyze HTML structures of 5000 webpages in order to identify the most widely-used HTML features. In the next step, the selected features of 1500 webpages are extracted using the same crawler. Suitable topics are given to each web document by users in a supervised learning process. A topic modeling technique is used over extracted features to build four heterogeneous webpages which are considered as one of the most challenging domains for information retrieval. Not only is the content of web documents constantly changing and new information is being added in every second, but they are written in different languages in different forms. In a 2015 research report [1], about 49 billion web pages have been indexed by Google and Bing crawlers. This shows an unprecedented growth in the volume of unstructured data in the web which has caused major problems in detection and access to relevant information. Recent trends in creating massive and unstructured web documents demonstrate the urgent need to manage the large amount of data stream or, at least, extract the most important features in order to meet today?s demands [2]. By unstructured, we mean that there are no computer- readable annotations that tell the computer the semantic meaning of the words in the text. The topic or subject category of a web document is any classifiers- C4.5, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy- which are separately adopted to train and test our data. The results of classifiers are compared and the high accurate classifier is selected. In order to examine our approach in a larger scale, a new set of 3500 web documents is evaluated using the selected classifier. Results show that the proposed system provides remarkable performance which is able to obtain 71.8% recognition rate.",0
Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering: A Replication,"In 2014, a Microsoft study investigated the sort of questions that data science applied to software engineering should answer. This resulted in 145 questions that developers considered relevant for data scientists to answer, thus providing a research agenda to the community. Fast forward to five years, no further studies investigated whether the questions from the software engineers at Microsoft hold for other software companies, including software-intensive companies with different primary focus (to which we refer as software-defined enterprises). Furthermore, it is not evident that the problems identified five years ago are still applicable, given the technological advances in software engineering. This paper presents a study at ING, a software-defined enterprise in banking in which over 15,000 IT staff provides in-house software solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive guide of questions for data scientists selected from the previous study at Microsoft along with our current work at ING. We replicated the original Microsoft study at ING, looking for questions that impact both software companies and software-defined enterprises and continue to impact software engineering. We also add new questions that emerged from differences in the context of the two companies and the five years gap in between. Our results show that software engineering questions for data scientists in the software-defined enterprise are largely similar to the software company, albeit with exceptions. We hope that the software engineering research community builds on the new list of questions to create a useful body of knowledge.",0
Roadmapping problems in practice: value creation from the perspective of the customers,"Roadmapping has been recognized as a critical activity for adding business value to a software product. The marketing literature has placed increasing emphasis on customer value and that value is created in customers? everyday activities. This paper presents an action research study on the roadmapping problems of two software product companies. The key findings were that customer knowledge was fragmented across different functions of the companies and that roadmapping neglected service development. To solve these problems, the analysis of customer value and customers? processes was integrated into roadmapping. Facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams were used to analyze the customers? processes in their entirety and to create a holistic view to roadmapping. The lessons learned offer practical means for software companies to shift their focus from the prioritization of software features to the analysis of customers? processes and the prioritization of customers? activities. That shift can promote value for customers and uncover new service business opportunities. Accordingly, this paper provides a six-step approach to adopt the value-creation logic from the customers? perspective into the existing roadmapping process of a company.",0
Requirement management--controlling quality at the upstream in commercial software project management,"Requirement Management in commercial software application development not only talks of gathering requirements from the customer it also highlights the need for a scientific step by step approach for eliciting requirement. Without thorough understanding of the requirements from customer point of view at this stage will lead to a cascading effect later on as it would involve rework and extra cost. Hence a complete scientific management approach is needed for this stage which is known as requirement management. Requirement Management takes the accountability of not only meeting the technical specifications of the customers but also involves defining an approach to take care of any change in the requirement needed later on. In addition to that requirement management takes care of tracing back each and every functionality requirement to the final delivered output. In this paper, based on experience, tools and techniques that can be used to gather requirements for commercial software application development have been presented. The process needed for managing change requests have also been discussed. Using this approach, the author has been successful in meeting customer requirements and reducing rework effort due to less defects being injected during project life cycle.",0
How do Practitioners Perceive the Relevance of Requirements Engineering Research? An Ongoing Study,"The relevance of Requirements Engineering (RE) research to practitioners is a prerequisite for problem-driven research in the area and key for a long-term dissemination of research results to everyday practice. To understand better how industry practitioners perceive the practical relevance of RE research, we have initiated the RE-Pract project, an international collaboration conducting an empirical study. This project opts for a replication of previous work done in two different domains and relies on survey research. To this end, we have designed a survey to be sent to several hundred industry practitioners at various companies around the world and ask them to rate their perceived practical relevance of the research described in a sample of 418 RE papers published between 2010 and 2015 at the RE, ICSE, FSE, ESEC/FSE, ESEM and REFSQ conferences. In this paper, we summarize our research protocol and present the current status of our study and the planned future steps.",0
Costs and obstacles encountered in technical debt management â€“ A case study,"Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor that characterizes the effect of immature software artifacts. The costs and benefits of TD, along with the uncertainty of its interest repayment, provide leverage for software managers, but also could lead to problems such as increased costs and lower quality during maintenance if it is left unattended. Therefore, effective approaches to TD management are needed by software practitioners. As one of our series of studies on TD management, this study was originally designed to reveal the cost side of explicit TD management. The study design required applying a simple proposed TD management approach to the subject project and then collecting cost information. Not surprisingly, we observed some deviation of the actual management process from our proposed one, which provided us with an opportunity to investigate the obstacles to explicitly managing TD. We also identified some costs and cost patterns related to TD management. Based on the insights gained from this study, we further propose strategies to overcome the obstacles and improve the application of TD management in practice.",0
Reducing Excess Requirements Through Orthogonal Categorizations During Problem Formulation: Results of a Factorial Experiment,"Problem formulation lays at the heart of systems engineering. While an over-constrained solution space may yield no satisficing solution affordably, properly defined solution spaces may enable developing solutions with high levels of affordability. Therefore, effective requirement elicitation from stakeholder needs is key to achieve a proper definition of the problem to be solved. Categorizing requirements according to predefined taxonomies is an inherent part of this activity and they are as diverse as engineering industries are. Conventional approaches, which use a designer-perspective, a contractual perspective, or a combination of both, facilitate the generation of excess facilitate the generation of excess requirements during requirements elicitation due to promoted design biases and overlaps between the different categories. In order to mitigate those problems, orthogonal, system-centric categorization methods have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, research has not measured the influence of any type of requirement taxonomy on the effectiveness in defining solution spaces of maximum size, i.e., without excess requirements with respect to a given set of stakeholder needs. In order to fill in this gap, this paper presents the results of a factorial experiment involving systems engineering practitioners that compares the effectiveness in eliciting less excess requirements of an orthogonal, system-centric categorization method versus traditional ones.",0
A systematic study on requirement engineering processes and practices in mauritius,"Requirement engineering processes have been used for many years in software development. The processes consist of four stages namely elicitation, analysis and negotiation, specification, and validation. The appropriate use of the different stages for a given project, and tailoring the stages to a specific requirement has been a challenge since requirement engineering varies from organization to organization. Nowadays, more than ever, software development projects are geared towards failures due to poor requirements. This paper analyses the requirement engineering processes across different organizations with the aim of identifying the difficulties that are encountered in the requirement engineering processes and the gap that exists between theory and practice. As resolution, solutions have been proposed to overcome the difficulties encountered and to bridge the gaps resulting in enhanced requirement engineering and potentially much better software.",0
What practitioners really want: requirements for visual notations in conceptual modeling,"This research was aimed at eliciting the requirements of practitioners who use conceptual modeling in their professional work for the visual notations of modeling languages. While the use of conceptual modeling in practice has been addressed, what practitioners in fact require of the visual notation of the modeling languages they use has received little attention. This work was thus motivated by the need to understand to what extent practitioners? requirements are acknowledged and accommodated by visual notation research efforts. A mixed-method study was conducted, with a survey being offered over the course of several months to LinkedIn professional groups. The requirements included in the survey were based on a leading design theory for visual notations, the Physics of Notations. After preprocessing, 104 participant responses were analyzed. Data analysis included descriptive coding and qualitative analysis of purposes for modeling and additional requirements beyond the scope of visual design. Statistical and factorial analysis was used to explore potential correlations between the importance of different requirements as perceived by practitioners and the demographic factors (e.g., domain, purpose, topics). The results indicate several correlations between demographic factors and the perceived importance of visual notation requirements, as well as differences in the perceived relative importance of different requirements for models used to communicate with modeling experts as compared to non-experts. Furthermore, the results show an evolution from trends identified in studies conducted in the previous decade. The identified correlations with practitioners? demographics reveal several research challenges that should be addressed, as well as the potential benefits of more purpose-specific tailoring of visual notation design. Furthermore, the shift in practitioner demographics as compared to those found in earlier work indicates that the research and development of conceptual modeling efforts needs to stay up-to-date with the way practitioners employ conceptual modeling.",0
Adaptive requirements prioritization (ARP): Improving decisions between conflicting requirements,"Prioritization of requirements is a core activity of requirements engineering. Conventionally used to resolve conflicting requirements, it can be performed on a wide variety of attributes, reflecting, for example, stakeholder value, value to business, cost, connectivity, or risk. Its benefit in decision making is unquestionable, yet existing techniques are ineffective for realistic sets of requirements and consequently their adoption by practitioners is scarce, particularly in the fields of hardware-intensive systems. The present research proposes an Adaptive Requirements Prioritization (ARP) method that improves decision making between conflicting requirements due to its principles of multidimensionality and objective-base (the right criteria are used for any particular decision), and its usability due its principles of openness (it can be tailored according to specific project needs) and structure (requirements are grouped in subsets so that existing techniques become effective). The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation for a variety of priority dimensions and priority levels.",0
New Frontiers for Requirements Engineering,"Requirements Engineering (RE) has grown from its humble beginnings to embrace a wide variety of techniques, drawn from many disciplines, and the diversity of tasks currently performed under the label of RE has grown beyond that encom-passed by software development. We briefly review how RE has evolved and observe that RE is now a collection of best practices for pragmatic, outcome-focused critical thinking - applicable to any domain. We discuss an alternative perspective on, and de-scription of, the discipline of RE and advocate for the evolution of RE toward a discipline that supports the application of RE prac-tice to any domain. We call upon RE practitioners to proactively engage in alternative domains and call upon researchers that adopt practices from other domains to actively engage with their inspiring domains. For both, we ask that they report upon their experience so that we can continue to expand RE frontiers.",0
Quality Requirements Analysis with Machine Learning.,"The importance of software quality requirements (QR) is being widely recognized, which motivates studies that investigate software requirements specifications (SRS) in practice and collect data on how much QR are written vs. functional requirements (FR) and what kind of QR are specified. It is useful to develop a tool that automates the process of filtering out QR statements from an SRS and classifying them into the quality characteristic attributes such as defined in the ISO/IEC 25000 quality model. We propose an approach that uses a machine learning technique to mechanize the process. With this mechanism, we can identify how each QR characteristic scatters over the document, i.e. how much in volume and in what way. A tool QRMiner is developed to support the process and case studies were conducted, taking thirteen SRS documents that were written for real use. We report our findings from these cases.",0
Software requirements for interoperable and standard-based power system modeling tools,"Standardization processes and collaborative tools are becoming essential for interoperable modeling and simulation of power systems. The implementation of new electrical network codes at European level requires the development of a common grid modeling exchange standard. Consequently, this requires the development of dynamic models which expose their individual and integrated physical behavior in simulations used in trade-off analyses. These analyses are of particularly importance due to the increasing number of renewable variable energy sources connected to the grid. The development of such models leads to the development of new requirements for power system studies, while ensuring interoperability, security, and privacy of the models. The use of open standards for modeling and simulation could allow the export of all the necessary model information and physical behavior to guarantee consistency between software vendors and stakeholders. This work presents a formalization of functional and non-functional requirements for new standard-compliant software tools using the System Modeling Language (SysML). This work also presents the implementation of these requirements using available information modeling and equation-based modeling standards, illustrating that standards can be combined for model exchange and co-simulation by the application of the FMI standard.",0
Understanding how problem formulation in systems engineering influences system affordability: a systems thinking investigation,"Systems engineering is promoted as the engineering discipline that facilitates success in the development of large-scale systems; yet these continue to significantly fail in all major dimensions: performance, cost, and schedule. Requirements are the cornerstone of this discipline because they often set the boundary conditions on which systems are developed, but their capability to influence system affordability seems questionable. The present research explores current practices of requirements engineering and, using systems thinking, investigates how they influence system affordability. A set of measures is proposed by the authors that would enable an active use of requirements engineering to facilitate the development of affordable systems.",0
Predicting Substance Use Disorder in ADHD Patients using Long-Short Term Memory Model,"About 20% of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are first diagnosed during adolescence. While preclinical experiments suggest that adolescent-onset exposure to ADHD medication is an important factor in the development of substance use disorder (SUD) phenotypes in adulthood, the long-term impact of ADHD medication initiated during adolescence has been largely unexplored in humans. Our analysis of 11,624 adolescent ADHD patients in the Truven database indicates that temporal medication features are the important factors on the health consequences related to SUD and ADHD medication initiation during adolescence.",0
Scenario-Driven Continuous Mobility Requirements Analysis in Mobile App Maintenance,"As mobile devices have become an indispensable part of people's lives, the growth of mobile app market is inevitably rapid. Accordingly, the mobile app users have increasing demands on the quality of the apps. Their tolerance towards bugs and poor usability of the apps is growing low. In addition, as the mobile devices and apps have enabled users to use them in various contexts , the mobility of the apps, referred to as their capability to provide ubiquitous services with quality, is also required. In this study, we propose the scenario driven approach of mobility requirements analysis with context and ways of interaction. It supports the continuous requirements analysis in the maintenance of mobile apps where their mobility is constantly maintained despite the changes in the features.",0
"Knowledge Transfer, Sharing, and Management System Based on Causality for Requirements Change Management","In software development, requirements changes cannot be avoided. Despite the importance of requirements change management, few studies in the literature concern requirements change knowledge management(RCKM). This study explored knowledge transfer and sharing of RCKM based on change cause analysis and the design of a knowledge management system(KMS) for change management. In this paper, previous research is discussed in three aspects: factors affecting knowledge transfer and sharing, methods to implement knowledge transfer and sharing, and the design of a KMS. After that, the results of a recent questionnaire are analyzed. Finally, this paper discusses the sources of tacit knowledge in the personnel management aspects of software development; the knowledge and the methods of knowledge transfer and sharing in the requirements change management process based on change cause analysis; the design of a data flowchart of repositories, and a prototype structure, logical model, and functional modules of RCKM systems. In conclusion, further study is suggested.",0
Interspecies information systems,"This article introduces a new class of socio-technical systems, interspecies information systems (IIS) by describing several examples of these systems emerging through the use of commercially available data-driven animal-centered technology. When animal-centered technology, such as pet wearables, cow health monitoring, or even wildlife drones captures animal data and inform humans of actions to take towards animals, interspecies information systems emerge. I discuss the importance of understanding them as information systems rather than isolated technology or technology-mediated interactions, and propose a conceptual model capturing the key components and information flow of a general interspecies information system. I conclude by proposing multiple practical challenges that are faced in the successful design, engineering and use of any IIS where animal data informs human actions.",0
Lessons learned from a local industrial energy efficiency initiative,"Industry accounts for 29% of UK energy use, with 86% derived from non-renewable sources, placing energy efficiency in this sector as a fundamental to sustainable development. Given that some 99% of UK industrial companies are Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), who are least able to devote specific resources to energy analysis, supportive initiatives in this area have the potential for significant savings and success. This paper presents and discusses the case study of a local government project called ?SUSTAIN Lincolnshire ? Phase 2? to improve the energy efficiency of industrial SMEs within its region. A critical analysis, starting from the existing literature, will centre on the problems of co-ordinating and encouraging a large number of SME to become pro-active in this area. This starts with the importance of clearly defined and understood requirements, through engagement and activities with SME, to achievements attainable beyond the project. Currently, this Council and others across Europe, have numerous initiatives, similar in style to the project considered. The critical analysis in this paper will allow those project initiators and stakeholders to take advantage of the lessons learned when developing similar projects. The paper identifies resources and techniques available to SME and highlights the difficulties in developing higher-level strategies, such as Industrial Symbiosis (IS), in the existing communities of hard-pressed SMEs. It shows the importance of persistence in this area for the initiating bodies and the benefit of building on outcomes in a coherent manner.",0
Mapping the State of the Art of Scientific Production on Requirements Engineering Research: A Bibliometric Analysis,"Requirements engineering (RE) is gaining acceptance by industries and practitioners as a significant process in systems development. Similarly, the publications on the research related to the RE topic progresses. However, there is a lack of study on the progressions of this research based on a bibliographic portfolio. This paper presents the emergence of the RE field and mapping the state of the art of scientific production using a bibliometric survey approach. This study identifies the research trends based on the observations of scientific production over the past two decades. Quantitative and qualitative information in requirements engineering research through various bibliographic attributes are presented, such as the leading journals, top-cited articles, top authors, and top countries. Research trends in RE can be observed based on the number of research themes, and the involvement of various disciplines from RE begin to get acknowledged until this study was conducted. The results provide evidence and an overview of future directions in this research field.",0
Learning the lessons from a regional industrial energy efficiency initiative,"Industry accounts for 29% of UK energy use, placing energy efficiency in this sector as a fundamental to sustainable development.

Higher Education Support to Small Medium Enterprises: A Local Experience in Energy Efficiency,"Industry accounts for 29 % of UK energy use, with 86 % derived from non-renewable sources, placing energy efficiency in this sector as a fundamental to sustainable development. Given that some 99 % of UK industrial companies are Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), who are least able to devote specific resources to energy analysis, supportive initiatives in this area have the potential for significant savings and success. This paper provides example and advice on methods of support from Higher Education (HE) to improve the sustainability of industrial SMEs. This is exampled through the experiences of a 24-month project called ?SUSTAIN Lincolnshire? with a focus on SME energy efficiency. A critical analysis, starting from the existing literature, will centre on the problems of co-ordinating and encouraging a large number of SME to become pro-active in this area. This uses a project life-cycle approach, discussing the importance of clearly defined requirements, SME engagement, lessons learned and further work beyond the project. Current initiatives in Higher Education/Industry cooperation make this paper particularly timely and its critical analysis will provide HE institutions with guidance and advice when developing similar projects. The paper identifies resources and techniques whilst highlighting the difficulties in developing higher-level strategies to the hard-pressed SME communities. It shows the importance of persistence in this area for the initiating bodies and the benefits of building on outcomes in a coherent manner. This paper has does not analyse the most appropriate areas for project deployment or the format in which they should be provided. It does, however, provide insights into the exploitation of local implementations.",0
Experiences in Using Practitioner's Checklists to Evaluate the Industrial Relevance of Requirements Engineering Experiments,"Background: A grand challenge for Requirement Engineering (RE) research is to help practitioners understand which RE methods work in what contexts and why. RE researchers recognize that for an RE method to be adopted in industry, RE practitioners should be able to evaluate the relevance of empirical studies to their practice. One possible approach to relevance evaluation is the set of perspective-based checklists proposed by Kitchenham et al. Specifically, the checklist from the practitioner's perspective seems to be a good candidate for evaluating the relevance of RE studies to RE practice. However, little is known about the applicability of this checklist to the RE field. Moreover, this checklist also requires a deeper analysis of its reliability. Aim: We propose a perspective-based checklist to the RE community that allows evaluating the relevance of experimental studies in RE from the practitioner's/consultant's viewpoint. Method: We followed an iterative design-science based approach in which we first analyzed the problems with a previously published checklist and then developed an operationalized proposal for a new checklist to counter these problems. We performed a reliability evaluation of this new checklist by having two practitioners apply the checklist on 24 papers that report experimental results on software requirements specifications' comprehensibility. Results: We report first-hand experiences of practitioners in evaluating the relevance of primary studies in RE, by using a perspective-based checklist. With respect to the reliability of the adjusted checklist, 9 of out 19 questions show an acceptable proportion of agreement (between two practitioners). Conclusions: Based on our experience, the contextualization and operationalization of a perspective-based checklist helps to make it more useful for the practitioners. However, to increase the reliability of the checklist, more reviewers and more discussion cycles are necessary.",0
Emerging Requirement Engineering Models: Identifying Challenges is Important and Providing Solutions is Even Better,"Requirement Engineering is one of the most crucial tasks because it serves as the foundation for any software. Four pillars of requirement engineering procedures underpin the entire software. The bricks that make up the software edifice are functional and non-functional needs. Finally, design, implementation, and testing add stories to the foundation, allowing a full software tower to be built on top of it. As a result, the foundation must be strong enough to support the remainder of the software tower. Requirement engineers have various hurdles to design successful software for this purpose. Requirement Engineering (RE) is emerging as an increasingly important discipline to promote the development of web applications, as these are designed to meet various stakeholder requirements, additional functional, information, multimedia, and usability requirements compared to traditional software applications. The requirements of software systems are a very important area in software engineering. The success of software systems depends on how it effectively meets the requirements of users. In this paper, the review of current state of requirements engineering in which requirements from users are checked analyzed with their consistency and correctness is presented, and then identifies the emerging models of requirement engineering. Firstly, the paper highlight the current activities that enable the understanding of goals and objectives for developing proposed software systems, then the focus is on the techniques for improving the precision, accuracy, and variety of requirements. Next, identification of the challenges of emerging requirement engineering models is explained. The challenges like security and global trend that posed by emerging models of the future. Finally, we are trying to suggest some solutions for the mentioned challenges.",0
Engineering Education Gaming: Case Study of Engineering Ethics Game Modeling,"People have become addicted to their electronic devices spending more time playing video games. This addiction could be due to the attractive and rapid development in technology of devices. Additionally, home quarantine precaution imposed by the COVID 19 pandemic increased one's connection to electronic devices. These reasons and much more affected the educational methodology landscape. On the other hand, old teaching techniques especially in the engineering education nowadays are not fulfilling the market needs [1], [2]. Engineers are required to be up to date as market requirements changes [3]. More practical teaching methods are expected to prepare fresh graduate engineers to the market [1]. These practical skills should be developed in safe environments with an economic, and more engaging ways to engineering students. With the help of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, this goal could be achieved [4]. This research aims to develop a VR game that meets these needs. This work focuses on understanding the system requirements of the VR game for engineering education using engineering ethics as a case study. Requirements investigation, understanding, and documentation are done using Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools. As a result, the system's requirements are identified with seven logical models and an initial physical model. Consequently, three entities are identified for this VR game: learners, instructor and advisor. Entities relationships also have been demarcated. Future work includes the models' validation, game prototyping, and implementation using learners and educators' feedbacks on the proposed VR game.",0
Mapping software testing practice with software testing research ? SERP-test taxonomy,There is a gap between software testing research and practice. One reason is the discrepancy between how testing research is reported and how testing challenges are perceived in industry. We propose the SERP-test taxonomy to structure information on testing interventions and practical testing challenges from a common perspective and thus bridge the communication gap. To develop the taxonomy we follow a systematic incremental approach. The SERP-test taxonomy may be used by both researchers and practitioners to classify and search for testing challenges or interventions. The SERP-test taxonomy also supports comparison of testing interventions by providing an instrument for assessing the distance between them and thus identify relevant points of comparisons.,0
How software engineering research aligns with design science: a review,"Background Assessing and communicating software engineering research can be challeng- ing. Design science is recognized as an appropriate research paradigm for applied research, but is rarely explicitly used as a way to present planned or achieved research contributions in software engineering. Applying the design science lens to software engineering research may improve the assessment and communication of research contributions. Aim Theaimofthisstudyis1)tounderstandwhetherthedesignsciencelenshelpssumma- rize and assess software engineering research contributions, and 2) to characterize different types of design science contributions in the software engineering literature. Method In previous research, we developed a visual abstract template, summarizing the core constructs of the design science paradigm. In this study, we use this template in a review of a set of 38 award winning software engineering publications to extract, analyze and characterize their design science contributions. Results We identified five clusters of papers, classifying them according to their different types of design science contributions. Conclusions The design science lens helps emphasize the theoretical contribution of research output?in terms of technological rules?and reflect on the practical relevance, novelty and rigor of the rules proposed by the research.",0
A Taxonomy for Improving Industry-Academia Communication in IoT Vulnerability Management,"Background: In software engineering, industryacademia is a symbiotic relationship. Researchers need to be aware of the industry to produce relevant research, while practitioners are educated in academia and could take advantage of empirical research. The SERP taxonomy architecture is designed to support communication between practitioners and researchers in software engineering. Objective: The purpose of this study is to analyze to what extent the SERP taxonomy architecture is useful for improving communication between researchers and practitioners in IoT vulnerability management. Method: We developed a SERP taxonomy for IoT vulnerability management, SERP-MENTION, in an incremental way. Along the development, we evaluated the developed taxonomy in a project of industry academia collaboration. Results: In addition to the taxonomy itself we elaborate on the taxonomy development process and the potential of SERP-MENTION to support communication between researchers and practitioners within the area. Conclusion: The SERP architecture can be used in a new field, it is perceived as useful by potential users to better describe and communicate research outputs and practical challenges in software vulnerability management.",0
A Method to Assess and Argue for Practical Significance in Software Engineering,"A key goal of empirical research in software engineering is to assess practical significance, which answers whether the observed effects of some compared treatments show a relevant difference in practice in realistic scenarios. Even though plenty of standard techniques exist to assess statistical significance, connecting it to practical significance is not straightforward or routinely done; indeed, only a few empirical studies in software engineering assess practical significance in a principled and systematic way. In this paper, we argue that Bayesian data analysis provides suitable tools to assess practical significance rigorously. We demonstrate our claims in a case study comparing different test techniques. The case study?s data was previously analyzed (Afzal et al., 2015) using standard techniques focusing on statistical significance. Here, we build a multilevel model of the same data, which we fit and validate using Bayesian techniques. Our method is to apply cumulative prospect theory on top of the statistical model to quantitatively connect our statistical analysis output to a practically meaningful context. This is then the basis both for assessing and arguing for practical significance. Our study demonstrates that Bayesian analysis provides a technically rigorous yet practical framework for empirical software engineering. A substantial side effect is that any uncertainty in the underlying data will be propagated through the statistical model, and its effects on practical significance are made clear. Thus, in combination with cumulative prospect theory, Bayesian analysis supports seamlessly assessing practical significance in an empirical software engineering context, thus potentially clarifying and extending the relevance of research for practitioners.",0
A Practical Guide to Select Quality Indicators for Assessing Pareto-Based Search Algorithms in Search-Based Software Engineering,"Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Pareto-based search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of non-dominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains.",0
Nonconformity Resolving Recommendations for Product Line Configuration,"In the context of large-scale system product line engineering, manual configuration is often mandatory and therefore inevitably introduces nonconformities: violating pre-defined constraints for conformance checking. Resolving nonconformities without proper tool support is more or less random, as there are usually hundreds and thousands of configurable parameters and conformance constraints, in the context of configuring a large-scale and directly deployable system. Moreover, inter-connections among constraints and configurable parameters worsen the feasibility of manual resolving nonconformities without proper tool support. In this paper, we present an automatic approach (named as Zen-FIX) to optimally recommend solutions to resolve nonconformities using multi-objective search. Solutions recommended by Zen-FIX conform to all pre-defined constraints and are optimized in terms of maximizing the overall efficiency of an interactive product configuration process. We evaluated Zen-FIX with a real-world case study containing 52454 optimization problems, with which we evaluated seven multi-objective search algorithms. Results show that MoCell outperformed all others: CellDE, IBEA, NSGA-II, PESA2, Random, SPEA2, for most of the problems, in terms of Efficiency (a combined metric of finding optimized solutions and time performance).",0
"Applying UML/MARTE on industrial projects: challenges, experiences, and guidelines","Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE) is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile, which has been developed to model concepts specific to Real-Time and Embedded Systems (RTES). In the last 5 years, we have applied UML/MARTE to three distinct industrial problems in three industry sectors: architecture modeling and configuration of large-scale and highly configurable integrated control systems, model-based robustness testing of communication-intensive systems, and model-based environment simulator generation of large-scale RTES for testing. In this paper, we report on our experience of solving these problems by applying UML/MARTE on four industrial case studies. We highlight the challenges we faced with respect to the industrial adoption of MARTE. Based on our combined experience, we derive a framework to guide practitioners for future applications of UML/MARTE in an industrial context. The framework provides a set of detailed guidelines that help reduce the gap between the modeling notations and real-world industrial application needs.",0
Model-based incremental conformance checking to enable interactive product configuration,"Context Model-based product line engineering (PLE) is a paradigm that can enable automated product configuration of large-scale software systems, in which models are used as an abstract specification of commonalities and variabilities of products of a product line. Objective In the context of PLE, providing immediate feedback on the correctness of a manual configuration step to users has a practical impact on whether a configuration process with tool support can be successfully adopted in practice. Method In an existing work, a UML-based variability modeling methodology named as SimPL and an interactive configuration process was proposed. Based on the existing work, we propose an automated, incremental and efficient conformance checking approach to ensure that the manual configuration of a variation point conforms to a set of pre-defined conformance rules specified in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). The proposed approach, named as Zen-CC, has been implemented as an integrated part of our product configuration and derivation tool: Zen-Configurator. Results The performance and scalability of Zen-CC have been evaluated with a real-world case study. Results show that Zen-CC significantly outperformed two baseline engines in terms of performance. Besides, the performance of Zen-CC remains stable during the configuration of all the 10 products of the product line and its efficiency also remains un-impacted even with the growing product complexity, which is not the case for both of the baseline engines. Conclusion The results suggest that Zen-CC performs practically well and is much more scalable than the two baseline engines and is scalable for configuring products with a larger number of variation points.",0
Automated Refactoring of OCL Constraints with Search,"Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints are typically used to provide precise semantics to models developed with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). When OCL constraints evolve regularly, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) and three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) to measure the understandability and maintainability of OCL constraints. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil&Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25 percent Complexity and 39 percent Coupling and improve 47.75 percent Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained positive results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.",0
Search-based decision ordering to facilitate product line engineering of Cyber-Physical System,"Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are naturally complex. Manual configuration of CPS product lines is error-prone and inefficient, which warrants the need for automated support of product configuration activities such as decision inference and decision ordering. A fully automated solution is often impossible for CPSs since some decisions must be made manually by configuration engineers and thus requiring an interactive and step-by-step configuration solution. Having an interactive solution with tool support in mind, we propose a search-based solution (named as Zen-DO) to support optimal ordering of configuration steps. The optimization objective has three parts: 1) minimizing overall manual configuration steps, 2) configuring most constraining decisions first, and 3) satisfying ordering dependencies among variabilities. We formulated our optimization objective as a fitness function and investigated it along with four search algorithms: Alternating Variable Method (AVM), (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Genetic Algorithm, and Random Search (a comparison baseline). Their performance is evaluated in terms of finding an optimal solution for two real-world case studies of varying complexity and results show that AVM and (1+1) EA significantly outperformed the others.",0
Quality Indicators in Search-Based Software Engineering: An Empirical Evaluation,"Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) researchers who apply multi-objective search algorithms (MOSAs) often assess the quality of solutions produced by MOSAs with one or more quality indicators (QIs). However, SBSE lacks evidence providing insights on commonly used QIs, especially about agreements among them and their relations with SBSE problems and applied MOSAs. Such evidence about QIs agreements is essential to understand relationships among QIs, identify redundant QIs, and consequently devise guidelines for SBSE researchers to select appropriate QIs for their specific contexts. To this end, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation to provide insights on commonly used QIs in the context of SBSE, by studying agreements among QIs with and without considering differences of SBSE problems and MOSAs. In addition, by defining a systematic process based on three common ways of comparing MOSAs in SBSE, we present additional observations that were automatically produced based on the results of our empirical evaluation. These observations can be used by SBSE researchers to gain a better understanding of the commonly used QIs in SBSE, in particular, regarding their agreements. Finally, based on the results, we also provide a set of guidelines for SBSE researchers to select appropriate QIs for their particular context.",0
Empowering Testing Activities with Modeling,"Research-Based Innovation (RBI) aims at bringing research-driven innovative solutions to the industrial problems identified from the industry in close collaboration with researchers. This paper focuses on presenting one such instance of RBI between Cisco Systems, Norway and the Software Engineering department of Simula Research Laboratory, Norway over the period of last nine years. The main topic of the collaboration was related to improving the current testing practice at Cisco with the use of models. We present a brief overview of various model-driven testing projects, and lessons learned from such RBI collaboration from researchers? perspective.",0
Design Science method and theory in a construction and engineering context:?a phronetic tale of research?,"Design Science as a research method offers the researcher a viable way of improving the outcome of research for both the researcher and the researched. In Construction and Engineering there is almost always the intention to better understand and then improve processes, materials or outcomes. Using two case studies of research adopting Design Science, one in Engineering and one in Construction, the advantages of the use of Design Science as the research method are highlighted. The desire to improve construction and engineering through a better understanding of ?practical wisdom? or domain expertise through use of the concept of phronesis enables the researcher to build solutions that reflect the practices and processes practitioners actually need, enhancing their own knowledge through the collaborative research process and enabling the researcher to better reflect on what the research produced.",0
Revisiting Criteria for Description of MDE Artifacts,"Large-scale collaboration in Model Driven Engineering (MDE) demands the use of one or more repositories such as GEMOC, ReMoDD and SEMAT, which share artifacts (e.g., models, meta-models, transformations, etc.) for global reuse scenarios. In order to benefit the MDE community from an important quality attribute (i.e., understandability of MDE artifacts), this work analyzed the information available in ReMoDD. We conducted a study of the representation of reusable assets conformance to the criteria found through the execution of a multivocal research protocol. We found that these assets are not in conformity with these criteria, thus hampering the establishment of future Software Ecosystems (SECOs) for MDE.",0
From User-Centered to Adoption-Centered Design: A Case Study of an HCI Research Innovation Becoming a Product,"As we increasingly strive for scientific rigor and generalizability in HCI research, should we entertain any hope that by doing good science, our discoveries will eventually be more transferrable to industry? We present an in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process of transitioning from a university project to a revenue-generating startup financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of non-user-centered stakeholders. To make the research-to-product transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect to their potential for commercial impact.",0
In Quest for Proper Mediums for Technology Transfer in Software Engineering,"Background: Successful transfer of the results of research projects into practice is of great interest to all project participants. It can be assumed that different transfer mediums fulfill technology transfer (TT) with different levels of success and that they are impaired by different kinds of barriers. Objective: The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding about the different mediums used for TT in software engineering, and to identify barriers weakening the success of the application of such mediums. Method: We conducted an exploratory study implemented by a survey in the context of a German research project with a broad range of used mediums. Results: The main reported barriers were low expectations of usefulness, no awareness of existence, lack of resources, or inadequateness in terms of outdated material or being in an immature state. Conclusions: We interpreted our results as symptoms of a lack of a dissemination plan in the project. Further work will be needed to explore the implications for the transfer of research results (knowledge and techniques) to practice.",0
"Using argumentation theory to analyse software practitionersâ€™ defeasible evidence, inference and belief","Context Software practitioners are often the primary source of information for software engineering research. They naturally produce information about their experiences of software practice, and the beliefs they infer from their experiences. Researchers must evaluate the quality and quantity of this information for their research. Objective To examine how concepts and methods from argumentation research can be used to study practitionersâ€™ evidence, inference and beliefs so as to better understand and improve software practice. Method We develop a preliminary framework and preliminary methodology, and use those to identify, extract and structure practitionersâ€™ evidence, inference and beliefs. We illustrate the application of the framework and methodology with examples from a practitioner's blog post. Result The practitioner uses (factual) stories, analogies, examples and popular opinion as evidence, and uses that evidence in defeasible reasoning to justify his beliefs and to rebut the beliefs of other practitioners. Conclusion The framework, methodology and examples could provide a foundation for software engineering researchers to develop a more sophisticated understanding of, and appreciation for, practitionersâ€™ defeasible evidence, inference and belief. Further work needs to automate (parts of) the methodology to support larger-scale application of the methodology.",0
Zero-permission acoustic cross-device tracking,"Adversaries today can embed tracking identifiers into ultrasonic sound and covertly transmit them between devices without users realizing that this is happening. To prevent such emerging privacy risks, mobile applications now require a request for an explicit user permission, at run-time, to get access to a device's microphone. In this paper, however, we show that current defenses are not enough. We introduce a novel approach to acoustic cross-device tracking, which does not require microphone access, but instead exploits the susceptibility of MEMS gyroscopes to acoustic vibrations at specific (ultrasonic) frequencies. Currently, no permissions are needed to access the gyroscope's data, and the gyroscope can be accessed from apps or even from a web browser. In this manner, gyroscopes in modern smartphones and smartwatches can be used as zero-permission receivers of ultrasonic signals, making cross-device tracking completely unnoticeable to users. We evaluate our approach on several mobile devices using different audio hardware, achieving 10-20bit/s transmission bandwidth at distances from 35cm to 16m in realistic attack scenarios. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures against the presented attack.",0
The Use of System Development Methodologies in the Development of Mobile Applications: Are they Worthy of Use?,"The implementation of system development methodologies (SDMs) in mobile applications (mobile apps) development has a positive effect on companies and their respective software projects. SDMs provide a framework for planning, executing, and managing the process of developing software systems. In this paper, we investigate the worthiness of using of SDMs in the development of mobile applications. A survey was conducted among software developers in various organizations. The organizations included software development companies, financial institutions, telecommunication companies, engineering companies and educational institutions. A total of 152 out of 392 questionnaires distributed, were returned, giving a response rate of 38.8%. Furthermore, the responses were categorized into two groups (users/non-users of SDMs) and T-test analysis was performed to determine the differences between the means of the two groups. The findings indicate that SDMs are effectively used in developing mobile apps and there are significant practical differences between the users and non-users of SDMs in mobile apps development in areas of organizational size, the number of developers in the organization, years of experience, the number of applications developed and application success. The users (companies and individuals) are larger, more experienced and more productive. Furthermore, the use of SDMs in mobile apps development leads to more successful mobile apps. We conclude that SDMs are indeed worthy of use in mobile apps development.",0
A case study on artefact-based RE improvement in practice,"Background: Most requirements engineering (RE) process improvement approaches are solution-driven and activity-based. They focus on the assessment of the RE of a company against an external norm of best practices. A consequence is that practitioners often have to rely on an improvement approach that skips a profound problem analysis and that results in an RE approach that might be alien to the organisational needs. Objective: In recent years, we have developed an RE improvement approach (called ArtREPI) that guides a holistic RE improvement against individual goals of a company putting primary attention to the quality of the artefacts. In this paper, we aim at exploring ArtREPI?s benefits and limitations. Method: We contribute an industrial evaluation of ArtREPI by relying on a case study research. Results: Our results suggest that ArtREPI is well-suited for the establishment of an RE that reflects a specific organisational culture but to some extent at the cost of efficiency resulting from intensive discussions on a terminology that suits all involved stakeholders. Conclusions: Our results reveal first benefits and limitations, but we can also conclude the need of longitudinal and independent investigations for which we herewith lay the foundation.",0
"The Unending Quest for Valid, Useful Software Engineering Theories","Using scientific disciplines as inspiration, some researchers have called for the creation of general theories for software engineering. I present a contrary view, drawing on recent work in the philosophy of engineering. Engineering theories are different to scientific theories, and are not judged by the same criteria. Software engineering researchers should strive to create valid theories about the uses of software-based systems, even if that leads to a multitude of theories that have narrow, overlapping scopes, are approximate, and have little explanatory power. The engineering imperative is that the predictions of software engineering theories should be consistent with actual behaviour of software-based systems, and that theories and should support assurances and explicit justification that systems will meet their requirements. Process theories are about the organisation of work and project management, and are relevant to cost and schedule requirements in software engineering. However, to directly provide evidence that software-based systems meet their main functional and non-functional requirements, software engineering researchers should focus on product theories, about the specifications, designs, code, and behaviours of software-based systems.",0
Is server virtualization implementation in business and public organizations a worthwhile investment?,"Globalization is responsible for rapid development and release of information technologies. Globalization drives the competitiveness of people and organizations. Competitiveness makes organizations in particular to seek for solutions to enhance their competitive edge. Recent survey results on server virtualization suggest that the need to enhance competitiveness by reducing costs and improving business productivity is a major reason for the adoption of server virtualization in organizations. Thus, in taking adoption decisions on emerging technologies such as server virtualization, the provocative question we ask is: Is server virtualization implementation in business and public organizations a worthwhile investment? The outcomes of this study clearly show the answer is YES. However, the pitfalls associated with the implementation of these technologies are capable of making future adopters skeptical. This study examined the benefits and drawbacks of server virtualization implementation in 83 South African organizations. Server virtualization implementation has couple of drawbacks, which should be looked into.",0
Assessing the Kinect technology acceptance/diffusion into healthcare (the case of physical therapy),"Ludic engagement provides opportunity to gain from available gaming innovations to efficiently enhance mobility, reduce cost and error, and improve quality of life, particularly for patients suffering from stroke or other traumas left with reduced mobility and access to physical therapy often needed for long periods of time. Early clinical trials and implementations have provided promising evidences to the feasibility of using sensors, speech, voice recognition and visual interaction functionality of gaming consoles for assessing and improving physical performance of patients. This paper studies the cause and effect interplay of the salient derivers in the acceptance of ludic engagement. It reports on the conducted literature review and by performing ethnographic interviews creates a combined map of users' mental landscape using fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). Then using FCM simulation, the scenario of financial stimulation is identified as the most successful path to the timely adoption of ludic engagement.",0
Towards improved Adoption: Effectiveness of Research Tools in the Real World.,One of the challenges in the area of software engi- neering research has been the low rate of adoption by industry of the tools and methods produced by university researchers. We present a model to improve the situation by providing tangible evidence that demonstrates the real-world effectiveness of such tools and methods. A survey of practising software engineers indicates that the approach in the model is valid and applicable. We apply and test the model for providing such evidence and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of static analysis using FindBugs. This model can be used to analyse the effectiveness of academic research contributions to industry and contribute towards improving their adoption.,0
"Technical Debt Management in Brazilian Software Organizations: A Need, an Expectation, or a Fact?","Maintenance is often the most expensive and time-consuming of all software system lifecycle phases. Technical Debt (TD) refers to technical decisions on shortcuts and workarounds taken during the software development. It affects the internal quality of software. Therefore, software maintenance can be difficult when the TD is not perceived or managed in the projects. Despite the increasing attention of practitioners and researchers, TD studies indicate its management (TDM) is still incipient. Particularly in Brazilian Software Organizations (BSOs), there is still a lack of information on how practitioners perceive and manage the TD in software projects. This paper reports the results of two studies aiming to investigate the current knowledge level of practitioners from BSOs regarding TD and TDM, and to produce a summary of the available technologies to manage TD. To achieve these objectives, we surveyed practitioners from BSOs and undertook a quasi-Systematic Literature Review (qSLR) to gather specific TDM technologies. The survey results indicated that the general BSOs practitioners' knowledge regarding TD and TDM is still low. Few participants from the survey reported managing TD. The qSLR results provide evidence-based information about a set of TDM technologies, synthesized in evidence briefings to facilitate their use by software practitioners in the industry. Moreover, this paper offers links to a research package to aid in the replication process and support future investigations.",0
A Mediating Effect of Internalization on Technology Adoption,"Many technology innovations fail. Only a few of them are successfully implemented. Most of the remaining are discontinued before long or fail to be routinized. Although employees attempted to adopt the innovation for some legitimacy reasons, they have not reached the stage of internalization in which they believe in the real value of the innovation and become committed to the innovation. The deficiency of internalization was utilized in many studies as an important factor for explaining the failed innovation cases. However, few empirical studies examine the role of internalization in technology adoption. This study aims to investigate a mediating effect of internalization on technology adoption.",0
Secure complex monitoring event processing,"In this paper, we present EMaaS, for Event Management as a Service, a multi-tenant cloud service to outsource the management of monitoring events in the cloud. Furthermore, we provide a secure multi-party computation (SMC) protocol for complex monitoring event processing. The protocol is integrated to EMaaS and uses some properties of encryption schemes. Finally, we evaluate the protocol security, and then discuss its implementation.",0
Communal Antecedents in the Adoption of Secure Coding Methodologies,"Technology acceptance model has demonstrated that technology adoption behavior can be explained by two user belief constructs: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A number of studies have explored how these beliefs develop by utilizing primarily individual-level antecedents. However, because innovation and new techniques bear a direct relation to social concerns, non-individual antecedents may be necessary. Therefore, in this study, social and organizational supports are used to understand how software developers foster beliefs regarding secure coding practices. We compiled data from 83 software developers to evaluate the technology acceptance model. Our findings show that these collective antecedents can effectively explain user belief constructs and the intention to adopt secure coding methodologies. These findings imply that society and organizations offering more concrete support programs will experience smoother deployment of security-enhancing measures.",0
A unified model of the technology push process and its application in a workshop setting,"The process of commercializing new technologies, i.e. of creating technology push innovations, is poorly understood and modeled in very different and heterogeneous ways in the academic literature. Furthermore, no framework exists up to now to allow for practical facilitation like Design Thinking supporting user-centric innovations. To tackle these shortcomings, this chapter aims to improve the understanding of the technology push process and take initial steps towards a practical methodological framework. The understanding is enhanced by creating a consolidated and unified model of the process which builds on a systematic literature review. Additionally, methods are identified, evaluated and combined into a workshop format for the most critical phase of technology application selection. A case example in a university setting shows that the workshop is well-suited to advance technologies. Both the process model and the workshop concept are relevant for the academic and practical contexts: The process model aids in better understanding the technology push process and unifies different views. The workshop is an essential first step in designing a systematic framework for practical technology push developments with concrete methods and tools. The methodology is new to the field of innovation management and forms a well-designed starting point for similar endeavors.",0
Transfering Software Form Univesities to Industries: A Case Study ICTL,"To develop digital control systems (software) is a very attractive idea for solving industrial control problems because the required budget for designing it could be lower than designing hardware for control systems; thus, several universities in Mexico are interested in developing digital control Toolkits that can be deployed in commercial platforms. Moreover, some industries need to improve their conventional control systems, so intelligent control systems are an excellent opportunity for being implemented as industrial solutions. However, when this software is transferred from universities to the industry sector, some considerations must be considered to avoid complications during the technology transfer process. This paper shows how software for intelligent control systems based on LabVIEW (ICTL) was transfer to the industry as well as the main steps that were followed to attract a market sector in the industrial automation segment. Also, this paper illustrates some experiences that were learned during the transferring process at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico.",0
The Evolution of an Enterprise System Implementation Methodology by Adaptation through Reflexivity,"In spite of an Enterprise Systems Implementation Methodology's (ESIM's) potential and significance for Enterprise Systems implementation, little attention has been paid to its evolution in ES literature. Moreover, current studies reveal contradictory findings and provide a fragmented understanding. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework underpinned by a morphogenetic approach for explaining how ESIM evolves by adaptation through reflexivity. Our qualitative study resulted in a richer description of ESIM contents differentiated by adaptation strategies through reflexivity. Four theoretically and empirically informed ESIM adaptation strategies, i.e. reorienting, embedding, aligning and connecting, with related conditions and effects are suggested. This study retains valuable insights of prior works in Information Systems Development (ISD) research, since ESIM might be regarded as one of the latest interventions undertaken in an attempt to improve the quality of an ES product and the productivity and quality of an implementation process.",0
"An industry-academia, multidisciplinary and expertise-heterogeneous design approach: A case study on designing for mobility","The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding of how to effectively develop design projects that simultaneously leverage industry and academic partners, participants from various disciplinary backgrounds, and various levels of expertise to solve complex problems. The article reports a single case of an ongoing project focused on designing smart and connected devices for mobility, which integrates the dimensions of interest. Our findings highlight the importance of careful planning of the collaborative process, contemplating offline and real-time communication opportunities, identifying cross-boundary roles, and considering the development of shared expertise and knowledge within the team. By confronting these findings with key literature, we offer five recommendations to inform similar future projects.",0
Ethical Interviews in Software Engineering,"Background: Despite a long history, numerous laws and regulations, ethics remains an unnatural topic for many software engineering researchers. Poor research ethics may lead to mistrust of research results, lost funding and retraction of publications. A core principle for research ethics is confidentiality, and anonymization is a standard approach to guarantee it. Many guidelines for qualitative software engineering research, and for qualitative research in general, exist, but these do not penetrate how and why to anonymize interview data. Aims: In this paper we aim to identify ethical guidelines for software engineering interview studies involving industrial practitioners. Method: By learning from previous experiences and listening to the authority of existing guidelines in the more mature field of medicine as well as in software engineering, a comprehensive set of checklists for interview studies was distilled. Results: The elements of an interview study were identified and ethical considerations and recommendations for each step were produced, in particular with respect to anonymization. Important ethical principles are: consent, beneficence, confidentiality, scientific value, researcher skill, justice, respect for law, and ethical reviews. Conclusions: The most important contribution of this study is the set of checklists for ethical interview studies. Future work is needed to refine these guidelines with respect to legal aspects and ethical boards.",0
On top of the consortium: Keeping control of consortium-building in ICT R amp;D programmes,"Research projects in the engineering domain are often performed in partnership between academia and industry. Some kinds of funding presuppose a specific blend and participation of different partners in the projects. The initiator of a project, the prospective consortium leader, thus has to take on board a selection of organisations to meet the requirements from the funding programme or funding body. One usual way is to ask ""old friends"", partners you know from previous collaboration, but sometimes it is not sufficient to get a well-balanced consortium with sufficient competence and/or country representation. On the European level, there are many attempts to help proposers to build a consortium, often named ""brokerage events"", ""proposer's days"" or the like. These often seem to encourage large consortia, both in principle and in practice. Large consortia can possibly help to be more complementary and well balanced, but there is no evidence that the quality of the project performance or result is better. The encouraged process can be described as a ""snowball"" method. New partners arrive more or less spontaneously, and in their turn bring more partners to the consortium. Often, groups of partners who already know one another tend to join a developing consortium cluster-wise, either by country or by research or competence area. From the funding programme or funding body, consortia are also encouraged to merge with one another, which gives the process of building a consortium another level of complexity. An advantage of this model can be that partners with previous experience join the consortium, group-wise. An opposite approach is to be open, but to stay in control of the consortium-building process. This can be done by giving successive tasks and instructions to the interested partners, without any promises, and just successively incorporating new partners in the consortium. This strategy is a structured semi-open selection process for the consortium, paired with the development of the proposal. We state the hypothesis that the ""standard"" mechanisms might lead to large consortia, loss of control and possibly bad performance, and that a more restricted method can lead to sufficiently sized consortia, help the consortium leader to keep control, and possibly lead to better quality of performance. To learn more about this, we have interviewed a number of experienced project managers to find out how they perform consortium-building in practice. We have also been interested in learning more about how they examine new research partners before inviting them to a research cooperation proposal or project.",0
"Enablers facilitating industry-academia, transnational education and university-community partnering agility in higher education","Purpose The study has a two-fold purpose: first, to identify the enablers of partnering agility in higher education, and, second, to analyze the interplay between the enablers. Design/methodology/approach Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) was used to construct a theoretical model of partnering agility enablers, and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank and segregate the enablers into independent, autonomous, dependent and linkage zones on the basis of their driving and dependence power. Findings The study helped in identifying eight enablers that can be instrumental in driving partnering agility in higher education. According to the TISM model, clarity on roles and responsibilities of partners was found to be the most crucial and vital enabler followed by resource sharing. Practical implications The conceptual model provides a new direction on how to develop and strengthen higher education partnerships. The model has prioritized all the crucial enablers that the management can work around in order to drive partnering agility in higher education institutions. Originality/value Studies in the past have majorly focused on academia?industry partnerships. This research has tried to provide a comprehensive view of the enablers and the multidirectional interplay between the enablers that can facilitate partnerships between academia and industry, Indian and international universities, and academia and community.",0
Bridging the ?Valley of Death?: Can Agile Principles Be Applied in Industry-Academia Research and Innovation Projects?,"Government funding supports industry-academia research and innovation projects in Norway, sharing the risk of the research component in innovation. However, funding alone may not be sufficient to overcome potential differences in collaborative agendas and ways of working. As a result, positive research outcomes often get stuck in the valley of death, instead of ending up as successful innovations that create value. To contribute to bridging the valley of death, we investigated the importance of six agile principles for collaborative industry-academia research and innovation projects, abbreviated IPN in Norway. The study was limited to the manufacturing sector. We surveyed 124 IPN project leaders (70 from industry; 54 from academia) to evaluate the importance of the knowledge management practices associated with the six agile principles across the three project stages. The statistical analyses indicate the consistency of the agile principles throughout the project stages. This means that agile principles are relevant for IPN projects and can be used as guidelines for improvement of the knowledge management practices. Moreover, the study identifies the agile principles that are perceived as most important to use in different stages of a project. It also identifies the different perceptions of the importance of agile principles of the project leaders from industry and academia. These findings can support project leaders who are implementing agile principles to industry-academia research and innovation projects. The results from the study can also support national and federal research/innovation councils in decision-making when assessing industrial research applications.",0
A comparative study of software process improvement implementation success factors,"Context It has been observed that software process improvement (SPI) initiatives have been around for more than a decade, yet many companies are still facing SPI implementation challenges. Objective In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, and the results are compared with the previously collected data of SPI implementation success factors. The overarching objective of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of success factors that play a positive role in SPI implementation; this will assist SPI managers in better designing and managing SPI programs. We are interested to discover if there are any differences in the success factors identified by the three research strategies used, that is, informal literature review, SLR, and interviews. Method Data were collected and analyzed using the three research strategies. For informal literature review, the snowballing technique was used. The SLR was conducted for formal literature reviews. For an empirical study, interviews were conducted with Australian SPI practitioners. Results Results show that (i) senior management commitment and (ii) staff involvement are the frequently cited common SPI success factors in all three research strategies. The results also uncover similarities and differences among the three research strategies regarding the importance of the SPI success factors: (i) SPI awareness is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and formal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.413, p?=?0.011; (ii) reviews are a frequently cited common SPI success factor in formal and informal literature reviews, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.517, p?=?0.001; and (iii) training and mentoring is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and an informal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.195, p?=?0.247. Conclusions The understanding of these factors can help both researchers and software development organizations in successfully planning and implementing SPI initiatives.

Difficulties in Running Experiments in the Software Industry: Experiences from the Trenches,"Controlled experiments in laboratory settings are relatively commonplace in software engineering, but experiments in industry are thin on the ground. Of the few existing cases, most are 1-1 (running one experiment at one company), just a few are n-1 (running n experiments at one company) and still fewer are 1-n (running one and the same experiment at n companies). In this paper we report the difficulties that we experienced running the same experiment at several companies. We ran the same experiment in five different settings at three companies, and the results were transferred to each company so that they could exploit the resulting evidence in their decision-making process. We have found that: 1) it was relatively easy to get companies involved; 2) they did not cooperate as much as they had agreed to in the project proposal; 3) our industrial environments imposed many more constraints on the experimental design than laboratory environments; 4) professionals were less motivated than students; 5) the reliability of the results could be compromised by subject characteristics and behaviour; and 6) experiment findings could not be transferred using just the standard reporting guidelines that are used for scientific articles.",0
Towards Scalable Non-Monotonic Stream Reasoning via Input Dependency Analysis,"Stream reasoning is an emerging research area focused on providing continuous reasoning solutions for data streams. The high expressiveness of non-monotonic reasoning enables complex decision making by managing defaults, commonsense, preferences, recursion, and non-determinism, but it is computationally intensive. The exponential growth in the availability of streaming data on the Web has seriously hindered the applicability of state-of-the-art non-monotonic reasoners to be applied to streaming information in a scalable way. In this paper, we address the issue of scalability for nonmonotonic stream reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) - an expressive reasoning approach based on disjunctive logic Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics, by analyzing input dependency. We introduce an input dependency graph to represent the relationships between input events based on the structure of a given logical rule set. The input dependency graph allows us to dynamically configure the streaming window size in order to maximise the scalability of the non-monotonic reasoner. We conduct an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness and ability of our proposed approach in improving the scalability of disjunctive logic programming with ASP in dynamic environments.",0
Framework for empirical examination and modeling structural dependencies among inhibitors that impact SPI implementation initiatives in software SMEs,"Context Since last more than one-decade software process improvement, widely known as SPI has received the attention of the software engineering community. Objective The objective of the paper is to empirically examine and develop a framework to model structural dependences among inhibitors that impact SPI initiatives in software SMEs. Methods Authors used mixed method approach (empirical analysis and interpretive structural modeling, ISM) to evaluate, model, and analyze the association between SPI inhibitors in software SMEs. Results The results from empirical analysis and ISM show that lack of management commitment, lack of resources, and lack of communication and information sharing are the key SPI inhibitors. The association of various inhibitors with SPI implementation is found statistically significant with effect size (0.42 < Ø < 0.75, P < 0.05). Also, Spearman's coefficient of correlation for rankings of SPI inhibitors is found to be moderate to high, ie, 0.601 (P = 0.01 < 0.05) for SLR and interviews; 0.794 (P = 0.00) for SLR and empirical analysis; and 0.711 (P = 0.002 < 0.01) for interviews and empirical analysis. Conclusions Analysis of SPI inhibitors through the proposed triangulation approach and development of software process improvement inhibitors model highlights the importance of structural dependencies among the inhibitors.",0
Software product assurance at the German space agency,"The DLR Space Administration designs and implements the German space program. While project management rests with the agency, suppliers are contracted for building the space devices and their software. As opposed to many other domains, these are often unique devices with uncommon and custom-built peripherals. Its software is specifically developed for a single mission only and controls critical functionality. A small coding error can mean the loss of a mission. For this reason, customer and supplier collaborate to improve products and processes to achieve better software at the end of a project. We discuss quality in the context of space projects, and report a cross-sectional view from a customer's perspective on various management tools for influencing suppliers' processes and product quality: standards, single-source tailoring and cross-company product assurance.

Integrative Double Kaizen Loop (IDKL): Towards a Culture of Continuous Learning and Sustainable Improvements for Software Organizations,"In the past decades, software organizations have been relying on implementing process improvement methods to advance quality, productivity, and predictability of their development and maintenance efforts. However, these methods have proven to be challenging to implement in many situations, and when implemented, their benefits are often not sustained. Commonly, the workforce requires guidance during the initial deployment, but what happens after the guidance stops? Why do not traditional improvement methods deliver the desired results? And, how do we maintain the improvements when they are realized? In response to these questions, we have combined social and organizational learning methods with Lean's continuous improvement philosophy, Kaizen, which has resulted in an IDKL model that has successfully promoted continuous learning and improvement. The IDKL has evolved through a real-life project with an industrial partner; the study employed ethnographic action research with 231 participants and had lasted for almost 3 years. The IDKL requires employees to continuously apply small improvements to the daily routines of the work-procedures. The small improvements by themselves are unobtrusive. However, the IDKL has helped the industrial partner to implant continuous improvement as a daily habit. This has led to realizing sustainable and noticeable improvements. The findings show that on average, Lead Time has dropped by 46 percent, Process Cycle Efficiency has increased by 137 percent, First-Pass Process Yield has increased by 27 percent, and Customer Satisfaction has increased by 25 percent.",0
Managing software process evolution for spacecraft from a customer?s perspective,"The Space Administration of the German Aerospace Center designs and implements the German space program. While project management rests with the agency, suppliers are contracted for building devices and their software. As opposed to many other domains, a spacecraft is a unique device with uncommon and custom-built peripherals. Its software is specifically developed for a single mission only and often controls critical functionality. A small coding error can mean the loss of the spacecraft and mission failure. For this reason, customer and supplier closely collaborate on the field of software quality. We report from a customer?s perspective on how we manage software quality and ensure that suppliers evolve their processes: We contribute to standards, tailor quality, and process requirements to establish them in projects, and engage in cross-company product quality collaboration.",0
Emperor?s new clothes: Transparency through metrication in customer-supplier relationships,"Space projects, and development of software embedded in these systems, are complex, sometimes costing hundreds of millions of Euros and involving several tiers of suppliers. An important means of improving mutual understanding is to increase transparency of the development status between customers and suppliers. We raise the problem of transparency in complex projects to the reader?s attention, and, relying on results of a small survey of practitioners, propose to use ECSS software metrics/KPIs as a mitigation. We present our metrication infrastructure, and describe issues to be considered when implementing an early metrication programme in a real-world, industry space project.",0
Evaluation of Software Fault Proneness with a Support Vector Machine and Biomedical Applications,"The high throughput and good quality software are developed if effective defect prone modules can be predicted by testers at early stages. This enables the testers to focus on the activities, allocation of effort, and efficient resource management. Accurate prediction of fault inclined modules in software development manner allows effective detection and identity of defects. The existing researches used support vector machine (SVM) in standalone mode in the sense that no pre-processing is performed before invoking classification; thus degrading the accuracy of prediction. This chapter delivered a singular approach combining SVM and feature choice for software fault proneness prediction (SFPP). Experiments suggest that the accuracy of the proposed method using five object-oriented (OO) metrics, that is, line of code (LOC), program level (L), branch count (BR), and unique operands. Hence, the OO metrics have a large prone in defect prone modules.",0
Tracking Project Progress with Earned Value Management Metrics,"According to the Project Management Institute (PMI) project management consists of planning, organizing, motivating and controlling resources such as time and cost in order to produce products with acceptable quality levels. As so, project managers must monitor and control project execution, i.e. verify actual progress and performance of a project with respect to the project plan and timely identify where changes must be made on both process and product. Earned Value Management (EVM) is a valuable technique for determining and monitoring the progress of a project as it indicates performance variances based on measures related to work progress, schedule and cost information. This technique requires that a set of metrics be systematically collected throughout the entire project. A consequence is that, for large and long projects, managers may encounter difficulties in interpreting all the information collected and using it for decision-making. To assist managers in this tedious task, in this paper we classify the EVM metrics distinguishing them into five conceptual classes and present an interpretation model that managers can adopt as checklist for monitoring EVM values and tracking the project?s progress. At this point of our research the decision model has been applied during an industrial project to monitor project progress and guide project manager decisions.",0
The Adoption of SMP: A Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) Perspective,"This research aims to examine the acceptability of SMP and to distinguish the adjustments which must be acquired to the system to make it worthy to users which in this case is the students. The research used a hierarchical regression for the data analysis between 220 students who stay in Universiti Malaysia Sabah Labuan International Campus (UMSLIC). Their participant is not being forced and purely voluntary. Empirical analysis via hierarchical regression confirmed that prescriptiveness, lifecycle, ease of use, usefulness and behavioural intention to adopt SMP. These empirical results give benefit for the Department of Academic Service (BPA) in UMSLIC. The department can formulate effective strategies to fulfil the demand of the student and making improvement of the system. The result of this study offer the current study towards the staff of the Department of Academic Services (BPA) that is achieved from this research is that it could help the BPA to improve and design the SMP system software.",0
"Exploring the role of knowledge, innovation and technology management (KNIT) capabilities that influence research and development","A supporting management discipline is an under researched phenomenon. A majority of firms? operating capabilities relating to knowledge, innovation and technology management as a supporting management discipline. This paper reviews the literature in the research and development (R&D) domain to formulate qand propose a conceptual model which is influenced by capabilities relating to knowledge, innovation and technology management. We performed a systematic literature review in which a range of articles were searched related to R&D, from 1990 to 2018. Our review is presented in two parts. The first part presents a descriptive analysis using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic View and Mata Analysis (PRISMA)protocol and the second part develop proposition based on keywords analysis. The review revealed that there are nine capabilities that contribute to influence on R&D based on three dimensions known as knowledge, innovation and technology management which correspond to some of the key resources that used to drive these capabilities. Finally, this work proposes a conceptual model based on the outcome of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) interpretation. This research may support current trends on the literature. The list of references may be considered a potential source for future research in this area",0
"Brazilian SMEs' innovation strategies: agro-industry, construction and retail industries","The Brazilian micro and small business support service (SEBRAE) developed the local innovation agents program (LIA) mainly to convey the culture of innovation to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By means of correlational hierarchical cluster analysis of 412 companies' innovation radar, this research aims to identify the main innovation strategies of SMEs in the agro-industry, construction, and retail industries. Among the main results, it is noteworthy that in all industries the platform dimension, which comprises common components for different products, is one of the most developed dimensions among the main innovation strategies. This result reinforces the incremental nature of innovation among SMEs. Moreover, the innovation strategies adopted by SMEs have involved dimensions other than just product development, such as organisational, brand, clients, distribution channels, and supply chain, among others.",0
The Maturation of Empirical Studies,"Conducting empirical studies and transferring their results into industry in a design discipline such as software engineering is ambitious. This is due to contextual restrictions, representativeness as well as problems in aggregating results from individual studies towards guidelines for practitioners. Nevertheless, they are necessary, as scientific contributions need to be challengeable. Significant progress in areas such as measurement, controlled experiments, industrial case studies, empirical based modeling, and packaging knowledge have been made over the past 30 to 40 years. External visibility has been increased significantly by means of books, conferences & journals! Future challenges include attracting more industrial contributions to the existing body of knowledge, using quantitative & qualitative studies to create more trustful evidences, and aggregation of empirical results. These challenges require community efforts.",0
Local spectral unmixing for target detection,"Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery provides, at each pixel, a radiance spectrum with up to hundreds of distinct wavelength channels. This high-dimensional spectral information allows for pixel-level material discrimination, including applications to remotely detecting the presence of particular materials of interest within a scene. Target detection takes a spectrum (or multiple spectra) corresponding to the target material, typically laboratory-measured, field-measured, or image-derived, and uses a detection algorithm to assign a target-likelihood score to each pixel in the image. Here, we explore the tradeoff between spatial accuracy and detection accuracy by presenting the CITRUS algorithm (Cueing Image Target Regions by Unmixing Spectra), which performs target detection on local patches, or tiles. Instead of assigning a detection score to each pixel, we assign a detection score to each tile, indicating the likelihood of the target being contained within that local region; the assumption is that detecting target-containing regions will have lower false alarm rates than when detecting target-containing pixels. Through local spectral unmixing in each tile, we identify the corresponding endmembers using the MaxD algorithm. We hypothesize that for tiles containing the target material in either full-pixel or sub-pixel abundances, the target spectrum will be within - or close to, in a Euclidean sense - the simplex described by those endmembers. The resulting detection map highlights the tiles with low target-to-simplex distances, and serves as a visual cueing tool for an analyst. The ultimate application here is target-region detection in broad-area spectral imagery. The methodology is detailed in this paper, and results are shown on a ground-truthed hyperspectral dataset.",0
University and Corporation Co-Operation?Social Computing in Medium Enterprises,This paper presents the outputs of the Social Computing project conducted in co-operation of the Faculty of Informatics and Management and Hradec IT Cluster.

A step-by-step performance assessment and improvement method for ERP implementation: Action case studies in Chinese companies,"The implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a complex process, and the failure rate remains very high. The literature has reported over 80 critical success factors for ERP implementation, but companies typically do not know to exploit them. In this article, a step-by-step assessment and improvement method for ERP implementation is proposed and applied in three companies. First, a five-stage ERP implementation model is proposed. Second, about 80 critical success factors (CSFs) from the literature are elaborated into key performance indices (KPIs), which are associated with each stage of ERP implementation by ten local ERP experts. Third, the weights of the KPIs are calculated using the Dumpsterâ€“Shafer method and the evaluation of ten experts. During the implementation process, performance is measured at each stage and remedial actions are identified if the performance is below expectation. An implementation flowchart is developed based on a five-stage model and the philosophy of continuous improvement. Three action cases in Chinese manufacturing companies are conducted to illustrate the effects of the assessment model, which is also currently being used by a consulting company specialising in ERP implementation. With further evaluation by local experts, the model has the potential to serve as a guideline for ERP implementation in other countries.",0
Grounded Design-a praxeological IS research perspective,"In this paper, we propose Grounded Design - a particular design research (DR) approach rooted in a practice-theoretical tradition. It assesses the quality of information technology (IT) design through evaluation of emerging changes in social practices, which result from the appropriation and use of IT artifacts. The paper starts with a systematic analysis of the reasons for persistent limitations of traditional information systems DR, specifically in coping with problems of contingency and self-referentiality. Following this critique, the principles of Grounded Design are presented. Grounded Design is applied in case studies where we reconstruct the social practices observed before and during the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts. We call these context-specific research endeavors ?design case studies.? In conducting these case studies, Grounded Design builds upon well-established research methods such as ethnographical field studies, participatory design and action research. To support the transferability of its situated findings, Grounded Design suggests documenting increasing numbers of design case studies to create an extended, comparative knowledge base. Comparing cases allows for the emergence of bottom-up concepts dealing with the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts in social practice.",0
Practice-based computing: Empirically grounded conceptualizations derived from design case studies,"The introduction of IT has changed the way we live in many ways. Historically, it can even be argued that socially embedded applications of information technology challenge and change practices to an extent rarely seen before with any other type of technological artifacts. If these IT artifacts have strong and recurrent impacts on people?s lives, we need to reconsider design practice artifacts which allow for anticipating use practices and bring together inspirational creativity with evaluative methods.",0
Improving the use of analytics and big data by changing the decision-making culture: A design approach,"Purpose Evolving digital technologies continue to enable new ways to collect and analyze data and this has led some researchers to claim that skillful use of data analytics and big data can radically improve a company?s performance, but that in order to achieve such improvements managers need to change their decision-making culture and to increase the degree of collaboration in the decision-making process. The purpose of this paper is to create an increased understanding of how a decision-making culture can be changed by using a design approach. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents an action research project in which the authors use a design approach. Findings By adopting a design approach organizations can change their decision-making culture, increase the degree of collaboration and also reduce the influence of power and politics on their decision-making. Research limitations/implications This paper proposes a new approach to changing a decision-making culture. Practical implications Using data analytics and big data, a design approach can support organizations change their decision-making culture resulting in better and more effective decisions. Originality/value This paper bridges design and decision-making theory in a novel approach to an old problem.",0
Agile Big Data Analytics for Web-Based Systems: An Architecture-Centric Approach,"This article contributes an architecture-centric methodology, called AABA (Architecture-centric Agile Big data Analytics), to address the technical, organizational, and rapid technology change challenges of both big data system development and agile delivery of big data analytics for Web-based Systems (WBS). As the first of its kind, AABA fills a methodological void by adopting an architecture-centric approach, advancing and integrating software architecture analysis and design, big data modeling and agile practices. This article describes how AABA was developed, evolved and validated simultaneously in 10 empirical WBS case studies through three CPR (Collaborative Practice Research) cycles. In addition, this article presents an 11th case study illustrating the processes, methods and techniques/tools in AABA for cost-effectively achieving business goals and architecture agility in a large scale WBS. All 11 case studies showed that architecture-centric design, development, and operation is key to taming technical complexity and achieving agility necessary for successful WBS big data analytics development. Our contribution is novel and important. The use of reference architectures, a design concepts catalog and architectural spikes in AABA are advancements to architecture design methods. In addition, our architecture-centric approach to DevOps was critical for achieving strategic control over continuous big data value delivery for WBS.",0
Big Data System Development: An Embedded Case Study with a Global Outsourcing Firm,"Big data system development is dramatically different from small (traditional, structured) data system development. At the end of 2014, big data deployment is still scarce and failures abound. Outsourcing has become a main strategy for many enterprises. We therefore selected an outsourcing company who has successfully deployed big data projects for our study. Our research results from analyzing 10 outsourced big data projects provide a glimpse into early adopters of big data, illuminates the challenges for system development that stem from the 5Vs of big data and crystallizes the importance of architecture design choices and technology selection. We followed a collaborative practice research (CPR) method to develop and validate a new method, called BDD. BDD is the first attempt to systematically combine architecture design with data modeling approaches to address big data system development challenges. The use of reference architectures and a technology catalog are advancements to architecture design methods and are proving to be well-suited for big data system architecture design and system development.",0
Governing nonprofit platform ecosystems--an information platform for refugees,"The number of refugees arriving in Europe increased dramatically in 2015. Following arrival at the host country, refugees need access to information on various topics such as applying for asylum, medical care, educational offerings, jobs, or social activities. As many different parties using different channels provide this information, refugees struggle to access relevant information at the right time. Our goal in addressing this information deficit is to support a digital information platform for refugees by developing a governance strategy for the ecosystem of information providers. Within an action research study based on a nonprofit project, we evaluate the implementation of governance mechanisms derived from platform and community governance literature. Our results show that governance mechanisms are implemented differently for nonprofit platform ecosystems than for commercial platform ecosystems. These results enhance the societal impact of the information platform developed in the project. The study contributes to theory on governance of platform ecosystems and IT-enabled collaboration by evaluating established governance mechanisms in the context of nonprofit platforms.",0
Competing values framework application to organizational effectiveness in voluntary organizations: A case study,"Although the widely used Competing Values Framework (CVF) has attracted considerable attention in the literature and has proven useful as an approach to organizational effectiveness, we know little about how it applies to voluntary organizations. We therefore combined CVF with rigorous action research methodology to analyze the organizational effectiveness of Right in the Community (RitC), a voluntary agency serving the developmentally disabled. As our results show, CVF?s three dimensions of organizational focus, structural preference, and managerial concern helped us improve the organization?s management of scarce resources, organizational structure and governance, and innovative capabilities. During the collaboration, we also observed tensions between heart and head that were particularly relevant for improving organizational effectiveness at RitC. We therefore propose extending CVF for voluntary organizations with a fourth dimension: motivational trait.",0
Inconsistent and incongruent frames during IT-enabled change: An action research study into sales process innovation,"Integrating research on the social construction of technology and social cognitive processes in organizations, technology frame of reference (TFR) theory has helped researchers investigate how stakeholder groups perceive information systems practices and opportunities, how these perceptions shift over time, and, how stakeholders may impact or leverage them to facilitate change. Such insights are particularly important in dynamic environments where individuals, groups, and organizations face a constant challenge to make sense of and respond to how industries undergo change, information technologies (IT) evolve, and new opportunities to transform processes and products emerge. Still, although extant research provides detailed accounts of TFR dynamics between groups, we know little about TFR dynamics in groups and about how intra- and inter-group TFRs interact during IT-enabled change. Accordingly, we report on an action research project in which we relied on TFR theory to assist organizational innovators in a rapidly growing mobile phone company, VoiceTech, during a sales force automation (SFA) project. Consistent with current TFR studies, our analyses reveal how the SFA project implicated frame incongruences between different stakeholder groups. In addition, our analyses reveal important inconsistencies in how individual groups framed the SFA project and consequential interactions between the observed inconsistencies and incongruences over time. Based on these findings, we argue that inconsistencies and incongruences in stakeholders? technological frames play equally important but quite distinct and interacting roles during IT-enabled change. As a result, we extend current TFR theory with a nuanced account of how IT-enabled change efforts implicate these two fundamental characteristics of framing processes. In conclusion, we discuss the empirical and theoretical contributions to TFR theory and highlight implications for future research and for the management of IT-enabled change in dynamic contexts.",0
Enabling effective operational risk management in a financial institution: An action research study,"Action research (AR) is significant for its promise to bridge the chasm between rigor and relevance by seeking to solve real-world problems while building scientific knowledge. In this spirit, in our research project, we argue for a return to the essence of AR?that is, focusing on problem, action, and reflection. Adopting the style of AR known as dialogical AR, we address the issue of operational risk management as encountered by a financial institution in Taiwan. In this AR project, the researchers work collaboratively with workers in a bank to manage the knowledge creation process as part of an operational risk management program. Through three AR cycles, our findings demonstrate that ongoing knowledge creation facilitates the transformation of existing organizational culture and helps practitioners to identify different types of operational risks. We also highlight the conditions under which insights from reflective dialogues between practitioners and researchers can encourage managers to open themselves to new and different ways of thinking and acting. Finally, we offer principles for undertaking effective dialogical AR.",0
ICT-enabled refugee integration: A research agenda,"The recent phenomenon that has become known as the European refugee crisis is, in reality, a global problem. Accordingly, issues regarding refugee integration have become a central debate topic worldwide. In this paper, we examine how refugees use information and communication technology (ICT) in different regions across the world to understand how ICT supports their desperate journey to safety, their stay in temporary settlement camps, and their post-settlement inclusion in host countries. We conducted a series of interviews with Syrian refugees in Berlin, Germany, to collect preliminary insights. Then, we organized panel discussions at two key information systems conferences (ICIS 2016 and ECIS 2017) that involved participants from various countries. The panel discussions revealed seven key research themes: accessibility to information, availability of education and linguistic resources, admissibility to labor markets and entrepreneurship opportunities, communicability with home country, connectedness with local population, interactivity with host government, and volunteer coordination. We discuss how ICT might help to address issues related to each theme, present research questions relevant to each theme, and supply an illustration of how ICT has been employed to address an aspect of each theme. Insights gathered lead to theoretical implications and future opportunities for research in the information systems field, practical implications for different stakeholders interested in refugee integration to consider, and social implications related to refugee crisis that we cannot ignore.",0
Evaluation of information system investments: a value dials approach to closing the theory-practice gap,"Failed or partially failed information systems (IS) investments continue to be a problem in both public and private sectors. Although there are many causes of such failure, lack of clarity about the goals and benefits expected and how they are to be realized is one of the major contributors. This is particularly so in the public sector where the purpose of IS investment is not to increase profits, but to accomplish social and political goals. One way of reducing failure and wastage rates is to have ex-ante evaluation. Over the past three decades IS research has proposed a plethora of new theoretical approaches to improving ex-ante evaluation, but with a few exceptions, these have had little impact on practice. This paper presents a way to address this gap between theory and practice. It proposes a way in which managers can improve IS investment evaluation by changing perspective from a focus on traditional analytic tools towards a design attitude that seeks to develop multi-criteria IS evaluation approach based on contextual experience and prior knowledge. The proposed approach enables organizations to design and develop a value case using value dials as a common language that defines what constitutes the value of particular IS investments for a specific context. To assess its effectiveness, this approach was applied using a multilevel dialogical action research project within a Swedish public organization. The findings show that managers in this organization significantly improved the effectiveness of their evaluation of IS investments.",0
Reflective technology assimilation: Facilitating electronic health record assimilation in small physician practices,"Effectively incorporating complex technology into organizational practices requires moving beyond initial plateaus of postadoption usage. However, achieving this is especially challenging for small businesses because competing priorities in addition to resource and attention constraints may lead to technology assimilation satisficing. With this context in mind, we conducted a four-year action research project in which we supported electronic health record (EHR) assimilation in 10 small physician practices by facilitating reflections to help these small organizations move beyond an initial plateau of postadoption EHR usage. Drawing from these results, we theorize reflective technology assimilation (RTA) as an emergent process of facilitating deeper learning and reflection within and across small resource- and attention-constrained organizations to enable ongoing technology assimilation. In addition, we articulate the foundational principles for reflective action research (RAR) as an approach in which researchers facilitate reflective problem solving while advancing theoretical knowledge.",0
Demystifying big data adoption: Beyond IT fashion and relative advantage,"There is a paradox in big data adoption: a peak of hype and simultaneously an unexpectedly low deployment rate. The present multiple case study research develops a Big Data Adoption (Big2) model that helps to explain this paradox and sheds light on the ?whether?, ?why?, and ?how? questions regarding big data adoption. The Big2 model extends beyond the existing Relative Advantage and IT Fashion theories to include organizational, environmental, social variables as well as new psychological factors that are unique to big data adoption. Our analysis reveals that the outcome of big data adoption is indeterministic, which defies the implicit assumption of most simplistic ?rational-calculus? models of innovation adoption: Relative Advantage is a necessary but not sufficient condition for big data adoption. Most importantly, our study uncovered a ?Deployment Gap? and a ?Limbo Stage? where companies continuously experiment for a long time and do not proceed to deployment despite the intent to adopt big data. As a result there are four big data adoption categories: Not adopting, Experimented but Not Adopting, Not Yet Deployed, Deployed. Our Big2 model contributes to provide a Paradigm Shift and Complexity Tolerance perspective to understand the ?why? in each of the 4 adoption categories. This study further identifies 9 complexity tolerance strategies to help narrow the Deployment Gap but also shows that big data is not for everyone.",0
Applying Options Thinking to Shape Generativity in Digital Innovation: An Action Research into Connected Cars,"Although extant research convincingly argues that managers can change product innovation practices by exploiting new forms of generativity afforded by digital technology, the literature has so far been silent on how incumbent firms may conceive of and implement requisite generative capability. Against this backdrop, we report from an action research study into a digital innovation initiative aimed at developing connected cars. The managers in charge of the initiative engaged us as they faced considerable skepticism and push-back from the organization. To help the firm embrace new innovation norms and practices, we therefore infused innovation theory and options thinking into the group of managers as a means to conceive of and implement generative capability. As a result, we present and validate an integrative theoretical model of how incumbent firms may leverage digital options thinking to shape their organizational and technological resources into requisite generative capability. In conclusion, we discuss the contributions of the model and the empirical results to extant literature on generative capability in digital innovation.",0
The Current State of Social Media Research for eParticipation in Developing Countries: A Literature Review,"While there is an increasing interest for conducting research on the importance of social media within the eParticipation area, more emphasis is still needed within the context of developing countries. We address this need by presenting a literature review on social media within eParticipation in developing countries, to add to the understanding of how these technologies influence the political environment. We discuss trends, contributions and challenges within this area, and propose a future research agenda. Furthermore, we propose a model of social media for eParticipation from a process view perspective to guide future research in this field.",0
Communication between Developers and Testers in Distributed Continuous Agile Testing,"Software developers and testers have to work together to achieve the goals of software development projects. In globally distributed software projects the development and testing are often scattered across multiple locations forming virtual teams. Further, the distributed projects are so complex that none of team members can possibly possess all the knowledge about the project individually. During testing in such teams, developers and testers need to coordinate and communicate frequently. However, coordination is affected by the availability of the project information, which is distributed among different project members and organizational structures. Many companies are facing decisions about how to apply agile methods in their distributed projects. These companies are often motivated by the opportunities of solving the coordination and communication difficulties associated with global software development. In this paper we investigate the communication between testers and developers in two teams from two software companies performing continuous agile testing in a distributed setting. We describe four communication practices used by the team: handover through issue tracker system, formal meetings, written communication and coordination by mutual adjustment. We also discuss communication between testers and developers in collocated versus distributed testers and developers. We have found that early participation of the testers is very important to the success of the handover between testers and developers. The communication between developers and testers is not sufficiently effective through written communication and that it changes depending on the type of the tasks and experience of the testers.",0
Useful business cases: value creation in IS projects,"Business cases have become popular as part of managing value creation in IS projects. Nevertheless, business cases are often poorly linked to value creation activities and organizations struggle to develop business cases that are useful and express more than simple cost savings. This action research study seeks to improve the usefulness of business cases in IS projects. We used collaborative action research with Danish municipalities to improve their practices when developing and using business cases and to change their perceptions of what constitutes a good business case that is useful during implementation and value creation. This article presents lessons learned from our action research, lessons that we incorporated into a business case method and subsequently evaluated with IS managers. There are three lessons on (1) improving the content of business cases, (2) how to develop business cases, and (3) the use of business cases in subsequent value creation. These lessons summarize our findings and the contributions are that we in the business case method propose to (1) include minimal contents, (2) develop social commitment, and (3) structure for dynamic use during value creation. We discuss the lessons and contributions related to research on IS business cases and value creation.",0
The Danish agenda for rethinking project management,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the similarities and differences between the Danish rethinking project management (RPM) initiative named Project Half Double (PHD) and the RPM research stream. The paper furthermore discusses how PHD and RPM can inspire each other in research and practice. Design/methodology/approach This is an empirical paper based on collaborative research between industry and researchers. PHD has developed principles and practices driven by industry consisting of ten leading stars and the impact, leadership and flow (ILF) method. The ten leading stars and ILF method are compared to RPM research. The comparative analysis is then used in a broader discussion about how the research-driven RPM initiative can enrich the industry-driven PHD initiative and vice versa depicted in a theoretical understanding of translations between global ideas and local implementations. Findings RPM and PHD share a focus on value creation, social processes, learning and complexity while PHD also focusses on lean thinking, agile thinking, front-end loading and leadership, which are largely topics beyond the RPM research stream. Originality/value The paper presents how stakeholders from Danish industry interpret the actuality in projects and how they want to move forward with a radically different project paradigm. This is expressed in the ten leading stars and ILF method, which is compared and contrasted to the existing RPM literature providing a foundation for further development of both RPM and PHD.",0
Adding Value Every Sprint: A Case Study on Large-Scale Continuous Requirements Engineering.,"Agile development practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, promise value through shorter time to market and increased flexibility. While these practices have been widely adopted in small-scale, they have shown to be challenging to adopt in large-scale, system development. This is often due to a distance between customer and developer in large scale systems, and the need to break down value from the whole system into manageable parts. The notion of value is fun- damental for agile methods, especially for practices such as continuous delivery to the customer. However, how value should be handled in devel- opment practices is not clearly understood. In this paper, we investigate how the notion of adding value in every sprint has been perceived in a large-scale system development. Based on an exploratory qualitative case study, the outcome shows that it is perceived beneficial by practitioners although it comes at a price and challenges exist.",0
Knowledge transfer planning and execution in offshore outsourcing: An applied approach,"In this paper, we report from a longitudinal project about knowledge transfer conducted in a major financial company headquartered in Denmark and an offshore development center located in Bangalore, India. We identify the main knowledge transfer challenges experienced by the case company. The challenges inform the conceptual design of a systematic five-step approach to the company?s knowledge transfer. Our main contribution is to illustrate how extant research can be applied to understand and solve the knowledge transfer challenges of a particular company in a way that fits with the outsourcing setup and the company culture. We also draw attention to the fact that client side managers play a crucial role in determining how and with what priority knowledge transfer can take place. Our research indicates that a first, important step towards ensuring successful knowledge transfer in outsourcing is to focus on the training and support of client side managers.",0
Assessing the effects of introducing a new software development process: a methodological description,"In this article, we report from a 22-months long action research study in which we evaluate the usefulness of a set of software development tools in an industrial setting, a small software company. We focus on how developers in the industry use and adopt these tools, what expectations they have on them, how the tools can be improved, and how the adoption process itself can be improved. We describe these change processes from a methodological perspective, how we monitored the processes, how we reviewed the outcomes, and the strategies that we applied. We show how the processes evolved, intermediate results, and the steps that were taken along the way based on the outcomes. We believe that the described study may inspire other tool-developers and/or researchers to organize similar studies to further our understanding of the complex processes involved in the adoption of software development tools in industry.",0
Continuous API Design for Software Ecosystems,"Today more and more software operates in a software ecosystem where software products and services are shared over a common technological platform between business actors. In such a setting, a software platform API becomes the interface between the platform and its owner (s) on the one side and other actors and their extensions on the other side. In such ecosystem context, platform API fitness for application development has a huge impact on the success of the ecosystem. However, software ecosystems are usually evolving at a high pace given their dynamic structure and the continuously changing business strategies of ecosystem actors. The design of APIs for software ecosystems therefore has to co-evolve. In this position paper, we propose a continuous (re-)assessment method for platform API's that takes into account ecosystem needs. We illustrate the method with insights from an ongoing case study.",0
CERSE - Catalog for empirical research in software engineering: A Systematic mapping study,"Context Empirical research in software engineering contributes towards developing scientific knowledge in this field, which in turn is relevant to inform decision-making in industry. A number of empirical studies have been carried out to date in software engineering, and the need for guidelines for conducting and evaluating such research has been stressed. Objective: The main goal of this mapping study is to identify and summarize the body of knowledge on research guidelines, assessment instruments and knowledge organization systems on how to conduct and evaluate empirical research in software engineering. Method: A systematic mapping study employing manual search and snowballing techniques was carried out to identify the suitable papers. To build up the catalog, we extracted and categorized information provided by the identified papers. Results: The mapping study comprises a list of 341 methodological papers, classified according to research methods, research phases covered, and type of instrument provided. Later, we derived a brief explanatory review of the instruments provided for each of the research methods. Conclusion: We provide: an aggregated body of knowledge on the state of the art relating to guidelines, assessment instruments and knowledge organization systems for carrying out empirical software engineering research; an exemplary usage scenario that can be used to guide those carrying out such studies is also provided. Finally, we discuss the catalogâ€™s implications for research practice and the needs for further research.",0
Teaching Software Developers to Perform UX Tasks,"Good UX design is becoming important within the industry when developing new products. This entails that UX skills have to be available in the development processes. This paper investigates the opportunities of using software developers as a UX work resource in the day-to-day working practice. This is done via an action research study where the developers were provided with material concerning a modified AB usability test, by training them in performing this type of work, and by using their feedback to improve the method and the material. The overall result of the study is positive and it is found that by using the developers' feedback in the modification process, the method has truly become applicable within an agile, industrial setting. In combination with a guideline and template this has induced the developers to feel confident in independently performing this type of work.",0
Evaluation of the information systems research framework: Empirical evidence from a design science research project,"Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence that the design science framework Information System Research (ISR) works in practice. More than ten years has passed since ISR was published in the well?cited article ?Design Science in Information Systems Research?. However, there is no thoroughly documented evaluation of ISR based on primary data. That is, existing evaluations are based on reconstructions of prior studies conducted for other purposes. To use an existing data set to answer new or extended research questions means to conduct a secondary analysis. We point to several risks related to secondary analyses and claim that popular design science research frameworks should be based on primary data. In this paper, we present an evaluation consisting of empirical experiences based on primary data. We have systematically collected experiences from a three?year research project and we present ting of both strengths and weaknesses are presented. The main strengths are: the bridging of the contextual environment with the design science activities and the rigorousness of testing IT artefacts. The main weaknesses are: imbalance in support for making contributions to both theory and practice, and ambiguity concerning the practitioners? role in design and evaluation of artefacts. We claim that the identified weaknesses can be used for further development of frameworks or methods concerning design science research.",0
Applying service-dominant logic to recurrent release of software: an action research study,"Purpose Fierce competition drives software vendors to rely on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) strategies and to continuously match new releases with customers? needs and competitors? moves. Such recurrent release practices pose specific challenges for software vendors which shape how they service customers. To address these challenges, this paper aims to apply service science to innovate strategies for SaaS release management. Design/methodology/approach Based on action research methodology, the authors collaborated closely with Software Inc., an alias for a large multinational software provider, to apply service-dominant logic systematically, to analyze and improve its SaaS release management process and to support ongoing value co-creation with its customers. Findings The authors provide a detailed account of how Software Inc. improved its SaaS release management practices; they extend current understanding of service innovation dynamics in SaaS environments and offer a model of value co-creation in SaaS release management grounded in the findings from Software Inc. Research limitations/implications The research draws on a single case study with particular characteristics. Still, it allows for analytical generalizations with both theoretical and practical implications for how SaaS managers can improve recurrent release practices based on foundational service-dominant logic principles. Practical implications The authors suggest that SaaS managers concentrate on knowledge-sharing with customers, ensure continuous communication among teams supporting the service, re-organize release management to enhance the value co-creation process, use technology to improve customer service experiences and use service mapping to improve release management and service quality. Originality/value The authors bridge service-dominant logic principles and SaaS knowledge by demonstrating how service-dominant logic can be used to improve SaaS release practices and by offering conceptual and practical knowledge about value co-creation between customers and suppliers in SaaS contexts.",0
Toward a complex adaptive system: The case of the Zhongguancun entrepreneurship ecosystem,"Viable entrepreneurship ecosystems (EEs), which provide sustainable competitive advantages to innovative regions, have become increasingly important for producing high-impact entrepreneurial firms. However, little is known about the complexity nature that viable EEs uncover under specific regional entrepreneurial contexts. By integrating the EE literature and complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, we conducted a case study on the Zhongguancun EE in China. We demonstrate six interrelated complexity properties of a viable EE: a large number of self-organized agents, nonlinear interactions, (in)sensitivity to initial conditions, adaptation to the environment, emergence of successful entrepreneurial firms, and coevolution. Moreover, the integration of these six complexity properties offers an overarching understanding of how the Zhongguancun EE maintained its viability over time. We contribute to the EE literature by developing a more nuanced complexity-based understanding of a viable EE and extend CAS theory at the ecosystem level by highlighting an EEâ€™s adaptive process to maintain its viability.",0
Collaborative research partnerships for knowledge mobilisation,"This study examines elements of collaborative research partnerships (CRPs) between university researchers and organisations who engage in knowledge mobilisation activities in education. The study uses key informant interviews and document analysis from one type of partnership, and a survey of university-community partnerships across Canada to explore this phenomenon. Findings demonstrate that working across university researchers and community organisations builds capacity for research use to inform decision making; CRPs are more informal than formal entities; how partners communicate is integral to their success; variance in partnership involvement does not impact the success of the partnership in goal meeting.",0
"Action in action research: Elaborating the concepts of action, roles and dilemmas in a public e-service development project","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the concept of action by addressing actions and roles in the practice of action research, illustrated by dilemmas in an action research project on information systems development in public sector. The main ambition with action research is being able to solve organisational problems through intervention and to contribute to scientific knowledge. The main emphasis has so far been on the ?research part?. Here the authors focus on the ?action part? of action research to generate rigorous research, to solve local problems and to deal with evident dilemmas in action research. Design/methodology/approach This is a qualitative case study. The empirical illustrations of this paper originate from an action research project that focused the two e-service development initiatives analysed below. The analysis is structured using key aspects and phases proposed by Avison et al. (2001). As a result of the analysis, the concept of action is elaborated. The action elements action, actor, motive, space and time are analysed together with different roles. This goes beyond the existing action research literature. Findings The conclusions show that there is a need to understand actions and roles within action research projects ? not separating action from research. Research is also seen as action. The practice of action research is also discussed as context-bounded interactive social action: action research as a recurrent, interactive and dynamic activity. It is also identified that the understanding of roles, actions and interaction can help handle dilemmas in action research. Research Limitations/implications The authors contribute to the body of knowledge concerning action research in the information systems research field and in general by exploring the need to study the concept of action (e.g. situations and elements), to be explicit concerning the different phases, roles and responsibilities and management of different dilemmas in action research. A limitation of this study is that the inter-organisational development character in this study adds an extra dimension into the practice of actions research only partially highlighted. Another limitation is focus on public agencies. However, this is not critical for the results on action elements and the action research dilemmas that are studied. Practical Implications The understanding of roles, actions and interaction can solve the dilemmas and challenges linked to the practice of action research in the information systems field, but such understanding can help discover and handle dilemmas in action research. Originality/value The originality in this research is an illustration of and a perspective of action research as a context-bounded interactive social action: action research as a recurrent, interactive and dynamic activity. The value is that this knowledge can help handle dilemmas in action research.",0
Data governance as a collective action problem,"While governing data as an organizational asset has clear benefits, mobilizing an organization to implement data governance remains elusive for practitioners. On that account, this paper examines why governing data is difficult in local government organizations. Based on a literature review and an empirical case study, we establish the inherent challenges and build on the notion of collective action to theorize the problem of data governance. Following an engaged scholarship approach, we collect empirical material through six group interviews with 34 representatives from 13 different Danish municipalities. We extend existing data governance research with our problem triangle that identifies and explicates the complex relations between six distinct challenges: value, collaboration, capabilities, overview, practices, and politics. We demonstrate the value in theorizing data governance as a collective action problem and argue for the necessity of ensuring researchers and practitioners achieve a common understanding of the inherent challenges, as a first step towards developing data governance solutions that are viable in practice.",0
Political maneuvering during business process transformation: A pluralist approach,"For years, managers have tried to improve organizational performance through business process transformation (BPT), and their experiences have informed IS research and practice. Although extant theory acknowledges the political nature of these dynamic transformation initiatives, researchers have yet to empirically investigate and theorize how organizational politics impacts BPT behaviors and outcomes. Drawing on a pluralist methodology, we present an embedded case study of a company-wide BPT project across four business units at the high-tech firm Terma. First, we apply different perspectives on organizational politics to develop detailed accounts of each business unit's response to the transformation initiative, which reveals four distinct patterns of BPT politics: ?applying the hammer?, ?struggling to engage?, ?walking the talk?, and ?keeping up appearances?. Next, we combine the empirical findings with extant literature to theorize how transformation agents and process users engage in politics during BPT implementation. As a result, our research leverages a pluralist approach to show how alternative political perspectives and forms of politics can help managers maneuver BPT initiatives in their roles as transformation agents and process users.",0
Flipped healthcare for better or worse,"The medical profession is highly specialized, demanding continuous learning, while also undergoing rapid development in the rise of data-driven healthcare. Based on clinical scenarios, this study explores how resident physicians view their roles and practices in relation to informed patients and patient-centric digital technologies. The paper illustrates how the new role of patients alters physicians? work and use of data to learn and update their professional practice. It suggests new possibilities for developing collegial competence and using patient experiences more systematically. Drawing on the notion of flipped healthcare, we argue that there is a need for new professional competencies in everyday data work, along with a change in attitudes, newly defined roles, and better ways to identify and develop reliable online sources. Finally, the role of patients, not only as consumers but also producers of healthcare, is a rather formidable and complex cultural change to be addressed.",0
How to reduce the UX bottleneck--train your software developers,"Usability and user experience (UX) methods come from academic environments, where industrial conditions such as time and resources are not of prime importance. Furthermore, usability and UX methods originate from a time when almost all software developments followed a traditional approach, such as the waterfall model. These two facts entail that existing methods often are too resource demanding and complex to apply directly into today?s agile, industrial environments. In this paper we make the claim that methods must be updated and tailored in order to be applicable within the agile, industrial development framework of today. We pursue a solution to simplify well-known methods and to train software developers to perform the UX work. To do this, three methods are modified via an iterative process together with the development of supporting materials. Software developers in three companies are trained in the methods to assess the approach. We find that it indeed is feasible to update and tailor existing usability and UX methods to fit into an agile, industrial environment. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to train developers to perform the usability and UX methods via one-day, in-situ sessions using an ?instructor?-teaching approach. The training is based on hands-on exercises and real-life tasks. This further boosts the developers? confidence in performing UX work and promises a better consideration of UX in the development phases. We evaluate our approach through observations of the developers performing the UX tasks on their own at a later point in time.",0
Engaged problem formulation in IS research,"?Is this the problem??: the question that haunts many information systems (IS) researchers when they pursue work relevant to both practice and research. Nevertheless, a deliberate answer to this question requires more than simply asking the involved IS practitioners. Deliberately formulating problems requires a more substantial engagement with the different stakeholders, especially when their problems are ill structured and situated in complex organizational settings. On this basis, we present an engaged approach to formulating IS problems with, not for, IS practitioners. We have come to understand engaged problem formulation as joint researching and as the defining of contemporary and complex problems by researchers and those practitioners who experience and know these problems. We used this approach in investigating IS management in Danish municipalities. In this paper, we present the approach to formulating problems in an engaged way. We discuss it in relation to ideas and assumptions that underpin engaged scholarship, and we discuss the implications for IS action research, design science research, and mixed",0
"Enablers, challenges and relationships between research impact and theory generation","Purpose Perceptions drawn from the construction management research (CMR) community regarding research impact (RI) and its relationship to theory generation (TG) are examined. Investigative emphasis is on RI and TG enablers and challenges (within an academic context). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative narrative data accrued from open-ended questions within a structured questionnaire survey are analysed using frequency, quantitative content analysis, and graphical methods. A model of the RI/TG interface is presented and discussed. Findings Principal RI enablers are ?facilitation? (industry engagement, time); while principal constraints include ?internal factors? (the academic, the university) and ?external factors? (collaboration, funding). Respective TG enablers are ?resources? (competence, time, funding) and corresponding challenges include ?external factors? (market forces, compliance). RI is considered a minor challenge to TG. Research limitations/implications The study adds empirical evidence to the ongoing RI debate within the UK generally and with regard to the CMR discipline more specifically. Originality/value RI research is relatively sparse, while the findings in regard to CMR are entirely novel.",0
Improving ISD agility in fast-moving software organizations,"Fast-moving software organizations must respond quickly to changing technological options and mar-ket trends while delivering high-quality services at competitive prices. Improving agility of infor-mation systems development (ISD) may reconcile these inherent tensions, but previous research of agility predominantly focused separately on managing either the individual project or the organiza-tion. Limited research has investigated the management that ties the agility of individual projects with the company agility characterizing fast-moving organizations. This paper reports an action research study on how to improve ISD agility in a fast-moving software organization. The study maps central problems in the ISD management to direct improvements of agility. Our following intervention ad-dressed method improvements in defining types of ISD by customer relations and integrating the method with the task management tool used by the organization. The paper discusses how the action research contributes to our understanding of ISD agility in fast-moving software organizations with a framework for mapping and evaluating improvements of agility. The action research specifically points out that project managers need to attend to the company?s agility in relating to customers, that company agility links to project agility, and that this requires light method and tool support.",0
How agile methods inspire project management-the half double initiative,"Increased complexity in projects has forced new project management initiatives. In software development several agile methods have emerged and are today highly implemented in practice. Observations of general project management practice show how it has been inspired by agile software development, but very little research addresses the issue of agile project management. In order to understand and to provide suggestions for future practice on how agility can be incorporated in general project management, this paper provides an analysis which compares ten characteristics of agile software development (identified in theory) and the Half Double Methodology developed by the Danish Project Half Double initiative; a Methodology developed with practitioners and tested in seven Danish case companies. The analysis shows how the general project management to a great extent has been inspired by agile methods, but also that general project management may be able to find more inspiration from agile methods.",0
Nine challenges for e-government action researchers,"Action research is widespread in many of the background disciplines that underpin the e-Government field and is beginning to take root as a legitimate e-Government research method. Canonical Action Research (CAR) is the most widely used form of action research; however it relies on premises that can be problematic in the e-Government context. This article details some of those underlying assumptions, and shows the difficulties that result when applied to a relatively typical e-Government case study: the implementation of an advanced email system in Danish public administration. The empirical experience calls many of the standard premises into question, and these are categorised. The authors summarize the resulting experience as nine challenges for action researchers working in the e-Government field, and investigate some possible responses.",0
Design science as nested problem solving,"This study investigates the types of research problem for which Design Science Research (DSR) is suitable. This requires that DSR approaches are compared and contrasted with inter- vention-free empirical approaches, in order to determine the strengths and weakness of each approach. From this distinction, three guidelines are presented to allow Information Systems (IS) researchers to identify appropriate research problems for DSR, namely (1) when the pre- scriptive aspect of the research problem is less mature than the analytical, explanatory, or predictive aspect, (2) when an opportunity arises to engage with a class of design problems where effective existing solutions do not yet exist, (3) when important elements of a system may only become visible through the act of design. These three guidelines are discussed in the context of the IS design literature, and illustrated using examples of existing DSR studies.",0
Accumulating design knowledge with reference models: insights from 12 years? research into data management,"Over the past several decades, digital technologies have evolved from supporting business processes and decision-making to becoming an integral part of business strategies. Although the IS discipline has extensive experience with digitalization and designing sociotechnical artifacts, the underlying design knowledge is seldom systematically accumulated across different settings and projects, and thus cannot be transferred and reused in new contexts. Motivated by this gap in the research, we turn to the data management field, where reference models have become important sources of descriptive and prescriptive domain knowledge. To study knowledge accumulation in reference models, we analyze the revelatory and extreme case of a longitudinal DSR process involving more than 30 European companies and 15 researchers from three universities over 12 years. The insights into reference model development allow us to theorize about knowledge accumulation mechanisms from both a process perspective and an artifact perspective: First, we observe that knowledge accu­mulation occurs in stages in response to technology?s evolving roles in business (problem space) and as a result of maturing design knowledge (solution space). Second, we find that reference models act as design boundary objects; they explicate and integrate knowledge from different disciplines and allow for the development of design knowledge over time?from descriptive (conceptual) models to prescriptive (capability or maturity) ones. To cope with fundamental changes in the prob­lem space, these models require continuous updating as well as transfer/exaptation to new problem spaces. Our findings inform the IS community about the fundamental logic of knowledge accumulation in longitudinal DSR processes.",0
Design science in the field: practice design research,"There exist different types or genres of design science research (DSR) in information systems, like laboratory-oriented and practice-oriented DSR. This paper investigates arguments for a practice-oriented approach to DSR. It uses the research approach of practice research as a starting point to elaborate on a practice-oriented DSR approach we label Practice Design Research (PDR). In doing so, we address two unresolved issues in IS DSR: Theorizing and evaluation. PDR consists of two inter-related sub-activities: theorizing and situational design inquiry. The conduct of situational design inquiry is described as iterative cycles of (1) pre-evaluate, (2) plan & design, (3) test & intervene and (4) post-evaluate. We justify the foundations of these iterative sub-activities/cycles through a theoretically informed argument based on pragmatist philosophy and practice theory.",0
Action design research: design of e-WIL for the manufacturing industry,"This paper reports on a design process of e-learning courses for competence development of experienced employees in the manufacturing industry. Through a cross- organizational collaborative action design research project the aim was to design e-learning courses at university level to support work-integrated learning. Two design- and learning cycles were evaluated over two years. The first cycle identified challenges that were applied to a pilot course in Industrial automation. From evaluation of this course we derived design principles applied to two further courses in Machining and Negotiation skills. The results from our empirical data suggest general principles as competence mapping work, collaborative manufacturing e-WIL cases and interactive learning technologies for design of e-WIL courses as boundary crossing activities to reach transformative learning integrated in the manufacturing industry.",0
"Comparison between Single, Dual and Triple Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Paradigms for P300 Speller","P300 based Speller systems are a typical application of BCIs that can be used as a communication device for users with spinal cord injury. In this paper, three different RSVP paradigms; single, dual and triple RSVP are compared in terms of character detection accuracy and ITR to find the optimal communication method for these users. Three subjects were tested to compare these methods in offline mode. The results of this comparison shows that character detection accuracy for the single, dual and triple RSVP paradigms are 0.78, 0.63 and 0.64, respectively. The mean of ITR for the single, dual and triple RSVP paradigms was also recorded to be 3.6534, 7.72 and 11.5 bit/min, respectively. Although the accuracy of the single paradigm is higher, but the ITR in the dual and triple paradigms increases significantly compared to the single paradigm. All EEGs have been recorded using an EMOTIV device which affects the quality and accuracy of the system.",0
Digital inclusion of elderly citizens for a sustainable society,"In an increasingly digitalised society, participation becomes dependent on digital skills ? the ability to understand and use the everyday Internet technologies that surround us. People who have difficulty acquiring these skills risk being digitally excluded. One such group is the elderly; all research studies show that they are disadvantaged. The project focuses on digital inclusion for elderly citizens, address-ing goal 10 of the United Nations global sustainability goals: reduced inequality within and among countries. It brings together researchers, industry and government in a collaborative practice (action research) program designed to increase theoretical knowledge of digital inclusion in Sweden, and to provide useful guidelines and tools for improving societal involvement of elderly citizens. The collabo-rative practice approach incorporates survey and interview techniques to ensure scientific rigor. A fea-ture of the project is the use of a cross-generational teaching and learning approach ? young people (digital natives) interacting with elderly - which has not previously been researched. Our initial results show that the benefits for the elderly include reduced isolation, more autonomy and independence, and better health.",0
Researching Cooperation and Communication in Continuous Software Engineering,"Continuous Software Engineering (CSE)-continuous development and deployment of software-and DevOps-the close cooperation or integration of operations and software development-is about to change how software is developed. Together with the tighter integration of development and operations also with usage this will change coordination and collaboration both between IT professionals and between developers and users. In this short paper, we discuss the CHASE dimension of three core research themes that begin to crystallize in literature. This position paper is intended as a 'call to arms' for the CHASE community to study CSE.",0
Product innovation with scrum: A longitudinal case study,"This paper describes the innovation processes used in a partnership between a company that provides asset integrity and maintenance management consulting services in the energy sector and a university. The challenge faced by the company is to make their in-house expertise more readily available to a worldwide audience. A longitudinal embedded case study has been used to investigate how installable desktop software applications have been redesigned to create a new set of cloud hosted software services. The innovation team adapted an agile scrum process to include exploratory prototyping and manage the geographical distribution of the team members. A minimum viable product was developed that integrated functional elements of previous software tools into an end-to-end data collection, analysis and visualisation product called AimHi which uses a cloud-hosted web services approach. The paper illustrates how the scrum software development method was tailored for a product innovation context. Extended periods of evaluation and reflection (field trials), prototyping and requirement refinement were combined with periods of incremental feature development using sprints. The AimHi product emerged from a technology transfer and innovation project that has successfully reconciled conflicting demands from customers, universities, partner companies and project staff members.",0
Strategizing for the bottom of the pyramid: An action research into a Mexican agribusiness,"Purpose While recent research has established that businesses can benefit from engaging with people at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP), the authors know little about the practices that managers can use to effectively strategize this ethically sound and financially attractive proposition and turn it into new business. Design/methodology/approach To address this gap, the authors reported on an action research study in which the authors collaborated with a major Mexican agribusiness, ANSA, to expand its market through value co-creation with the country?s poorest farmers. To shape the strategizing, the authors combined dynamic capability theory and options theory, and the authors used the asset hexagon framework to understand the BOP population?s needs. Findings The authors offer a detailed account of how ANSA?s management team collaborated downstream with distributors and farmers and upstream with suppliers to grow a new micro-franchise business that increases the well-being of the poorest farmers and creates additional business opportunities. The research describes how firms can strategize and implement new business ventures for co-creating value with the BOP population. The results are a process model and related propositions for strategizing value co-creation with BOP. Originality/value The authors offer new empirical insights, a grounded process model and model-related propositions on strategizing BOP options. As such, the study contributes to the BOP literature by joining critical ethics with actionable knowledge of how such efforts may unfold and by demonstrating how theory may be enacted and developed in the process.",0
Closing the practice loop: Practice design research,"There exist different types or genres of design science research (DSR) in information systems, like laboratory-oriented and practice-oriented DSR. This paper investigates different argu- ments for practice-oriented approach to DSR. It uses the research approach of practice re- search as a starting point and elaborates then a possible approach to practice-oriented DSR, labelled Practice Design Research (PDR). This approach addresses some unresolved issues in IS DSR like the roles of theorizing and evaluation. PDR consists of two inter-related sub- activities: theorizing and situational design inquiry. The conduct of situational design inquiry is described as iterative cycles of 1) pre-evaluate, 2) plan & design, 3) test & intervene and 4) post-evaluate. These four sub-activities are described through iterative sub-cycles. The foun- dations of these iterative sub-activities/cycles in pragmatist philosophy and theory are expli- cated.",0
Mind the gap: A collaborative competence e-learning model between university and industry,"This article departure from the effects that inter-organizational collaboration brings for the participating partners, specifically from design-related activities of e-learning courses and co-production. The research focus is on critical factors for inter-organizational collaborative e-learning and co-production between university and industry. We describe the process of a six-year longitudinal collaborative action research project including six cases and three phases, initialization, implementation and dissemination. The analysis is conducted from a multi-stakeholder perspective; managers, teachers, and practitioners. Overall aim is to reach for a sustainable collaborative competence e-learning model (CCeM) that will increase industrial employees? competences. Main contribution is that co-production of knowledge entails three levels of activities among actors; to have insight into the purposes and practices of others, the capacity to transform the problems of a practice and together build common knowledge and finally the capacity of mutually co-produce knowledge acted upon in practice towards transformations in the workplace.",0
IT project portfolio governance practice: An investigation into work design problems,"As organizations increasingly invest in IT-enabled innovation, practitioners become dependent on IT project portfolio management to mitigate risks generated from multiple projects. However, our knowledge about IT project portfolio governance practices and how interactions between different structural arrangements enable or hinder effective portfolio management is limited. Against that backdrop, we report a case study of IT project portfolio governance in a Danish municipality. Drawing on work design theory (WDT), we identify three types of governance problems?hierarchical decomposition, modularity, and complex network problems?and we uncover the network of observed governance problems in the municipality?s portfolio management practices. As a result, we offer two contributions: a detailed empirical account of IT project portfolio governance, and a demonstration of how WDT can help explain problems in IT project portfolio governance practices. In conclusion, we discuss how these results may inform future research and help organizations improve governance practices in similar contexts.",0
Making design research relevant for design practice: What is in the way?,"Knowledge from academic design research projects does not always help design professionals to actually strengthen their work. Based on a multi-case study, this paper describes how researchers view the impact of their design research projects on design practice and what they do to achieve this. Even in projects where impact on design practice is a stated ambition, several challenges can stand in the way, such as a lack of funding opportunities and unclarity on the needs of design practice. The paper provides tips for researchers and funding parties who want to inform design practice by research, including tips to operationalize design practice roles.",0
The impact of ERP system on academic performance: a case study approach,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a very powerful solution to many academic and non-academic institutions in case it has been implemented and used effectively. Otherwise, the system will interrupt several business processes. This research paper investigates the impact of ERP system on academic performance at Sohar University. A survey questionnaire is distributed to several academic stakeholders to investigate the impact of ERP system on academic performance within the University context. A total of 110 questionnaires was received from the key academic stakeholders to examine the relationship between the three core ERP modules i.e. the students? information module, the financial module, and human resource module. The research outcomes indicate that there is a relationship between the three modules and the academic performance. However, only students? information module and financial management module demonstrate a significant impact on academic performance, though the human resource module shows no impact on the academic performance at Sohar University. This study is a single case study approach, which might limit the findings to be generalized on other education institutes, but it gives a chance to other researchers to do multiple case studies in other Universities in the region.",0
Accumulating design knowledge: a mechanisms-based approach,"We develop an empirically grounded understanding of how design knowledge accumulates over time. Drawing from theory on knowledge creation, we conceptualize accumulation along the goals and scope of knowledge in DSR as a distinct knowledge creation problem. Through two empirical studies, we theorize knowledge accumulation in DSR by unpacking (1) three knowledge creation mechanisms, and (2) explaining how their interplay forms different patterns of knowledge creation over time. We contribute a theoretical framework conducive to integrating knowledge produced through different methods by introducing the knowledge creation processes as a distinct unit of analysis in DSR and by pointing out that extant procedural models may need revision to account for the continuous knowledge creation occurring in potentially multiyear DSR projects",0
Pluralist theory building: A methodology for generalizing from data to theory,"We propose pluralist theory building as a methodology that leverages the power of multiperspective inquiry to develop new theory from data. The paper presents the rationale for the methodology, its combination of generalization and pluralism, and the process involved in its application. When researchers use pluralist theory building, they move between description and theory and between single and multiple perspectives through four iterative steps with specific deliverables: create perspective accounts, synthesize multiperspective account, create theory fragments, and synthesize pluralist theory. Drawing on a study that served as experiential background for developing the methodology, we offer insights into the challenges involved in using the methodology and the activities in which researchers may engage to address these challenges. In conclusion, we argue that pluralist theory building offers a novel and practically useful approach to empirically based theorizing that leverages Mingers?s pragmatic approach to pluralism (2001) and extends Lee and Baskerville?s (2003) generalization framework into a detailed iterative process with steps, deliverables, challenges, and activities.",0
The Project Strategy Matrix: Systematizing the Design and Management of an Explicit Project Strategy,"The notion of project strategy, i.e., the strategy of an individual project, remains an open field of investigation. Despite the significance of the topic, a few works in the literature examine the subject in a systematic way. Likewise, project strategy has not yet become a first-class, widely used construct, and an integral element of current project management practices. Moreover, most of the existing ideas around project strategy focus on business and management aspects, such as the alignment of projects with corporate strategy and project success factors. Consequently, limited support is provided with respect to the implementation aspects of project strategy. The main goal of this article is to bridge this gap. Specifically, to achieve this goal, we first discuss and exemplify the significance of an explicit project strategy. Subsequently, following a relevant literature review, we put forward a methodological means, called the project strategy matrix, which can be applied to design, capture, communicate, and manage the concrete strategy of a project. Such means capitalize on and adapt Rumelt's seminal work on business strategy, in a more problem-solving-oriented approach that puts emphasis on the key challenges and constraints of projects. We employ a real-world scenario of an Information Technology project to illustrate the case, to support our argumentation and to exemplify the project strategy matrix. Moreover, based on practical experience in a number of projects using a collaborative practice research approach, we report relevant findings and provide insights on the way the project strategy matrix can be applied in the real world. Finally, we call for an intensification of research on the topic of project strategy and make concrete recommendations in this regard.",0
Mediating boundaries between knowledge and knowing: ICT and R4D praxis,"This article reflects critically on the use of a wiki as a data repository for knowledge transfer and as a mediating technical platform for social learning in the context of a multi-country programme of agricultural research for development. The wiki was designed to foster sustainable social learning and an emergent community of practice among biophysical and social researchers acting for the first time as co-researchers. Over time, the technologically mediated element of the learning system was judged to have failed. The article is based on an inquiry that asked ?How can learning system design cultivate learning opportunities and respond to learning challenges in an online environment to support research for development practice?? The article also considers the wider context and institutional setting in which the knowledge work took place.",0
Scrum for product innovation: a longitudinal embedded case study,"This article describes the innovation processes used in a partnership between Add Latent Ltd., an asset integrity and maintenance management consulting services provider in the energy sector and University of Salford. The challenge faced by the company is to make their in-house expertise more readily available to a worldwide audience. A longitudinal embedded case study has been used to investigate how installable desktop software applications have been redesigned to create a new set of cloud hosted software services. The innovation team adapted an agile scrum process to include exploratory prototyping and manage the geographical distribution of the team members. A minimum viable product was developed that integrated functional elements of previous software tools into an end-to-end data collection, analysis and visualisation product called AimHi which uses a cloud-hosted web services approach. Field trials were conducted using the software at the Uniper, Isle of Grain power station in Kent, UK. Enhancements were made to the AimHi product which was adopted for use at the Uniper site. The product emerged from a Knwledge Transfer Partnership whci was evaluated on cmplettion by InnovateUK and awarded the highest possible ?outstanding? grade. The article illustrates how the scrum software development method was tailored for a product innovation context. Extended periods of evaluation and reflection, prototyping and requirement refinement were combined with periods of incremental feature development using sprints. The AimHi product emerged from a technology transfer and innovation project that has successfully reconciled conflicting demands from customers, universities, partner companies and project staff members.",0
A socio-technical approach to manage analytics-as-a-service--results of an action design research project,"The ability to generate business-relevant information and its use for business process improvements is a key success factor for businesses today. Answering the call for further research on success-relevant practices and instruments for managing business analytics, we report on the results of a three- year action design research project at a global car manufacturer. Drawing on the socio-technical systems theory, we identify seven meta-requirements and specify four principles for the design of an instrument to manage Analytics-as-a-Service (Aaas) portfolios. Our results reinforce the importance of coordinating different socio-technical components in business analytics initiatives and demonstrate how concrete management instruments, such as the proposed portfolio management tool, contribute to socio-technical alignment. For practitioners, the documented design components may provide guidance on how to design and implement similar instruments that support the management of Aaas portfolios.",0

Designing and orchestrating embedded innovation networks: An inquiry into microfranchising in Bangladesh,"Microfranchising has emerged as a potential strategy to rapidly scale up entrepreneurship within base of the pyramid (BOP) markets in order to contribute to poverty reduction and to increase economic growth. However, we know little about how such networks are designed and orchestrated in resource-scarce settings to co-create value with the different parties involved. To address this gap, we report a longitudinal case study of an emerging microfranchise network social enterprise, currently facilitated by CARE, a global humanitarian and development organization, to provide timely access to quality, affordable agricultural input and services for millions of small-scale poor farmers in Bangladesh. We draw on the orchestration of innovation network theory developed by Dhanaraj and Parkhe (2006) and the notion of network imprinting (Marquis and Tilcsik, 2013) to analyze the emerging microfranchise network in Bangladesh. As a result, we offer two types of contributions to theory and to practice. First, we offer a detailed account of how these theories are relevant and applicable to analyze and explain the emergence of microfranchise networks, and we present two key propositions to generalize to theory. Furthermore, we propose an integrated framework, combining the two theories for scholars and practitioners interested in designing innovation networks. Second, based on these empirical results and extant theory, we offer three main lessons for practitioners to advance the industry by designing and orchestrating microfranchise innovation networks in embedded contexts to achieve positive financial and social impacts.",0
Insights into practitioner design science research,"Building on two previous papers that focused on the concept of Practitioner Design Science Research [1, 2], this paper: (i) presents the Practitioners Design Science Research (PDSR) Canvas, a visual guide for practitioners undertaking DSR, and (ii) utilises it as a lens to analyse the insights of 48 practitioners on their DSR journey. Data is primarily gathered from 48 practitioners, of which, 34 have completed a 12-month Design Science Research study, with the other 14 in the final stages of their journey. This unique practitioner perspective further develops the novel concept of PDSR which enables practitioners to engage with the academic community and not the other way around. Key findings show that practitioners have challenges with the practical (relevance) aspects of DSR as well as the research (rigour) aspects. Nonetheless, the analysis indicates that with a clear depiction of DSR, the gap between practice and research may not be as difficult to bridge as previously thought. However, this requires the IS community to rethink their definition of engaged scholarship from one that solely focuses on the academic as the researcher to one that also includes the practitioner.",0
Six issues in which IS and CSCW research communities differ,"Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) has become increasingly positioned as a subfield of human-computer interaction (HCI). Earlier, CSCW has had a closer connection to the Information Systems (IS) field, but this relationship has seemed to become more distant. In this paper we reflect on the distinct characteristics of the research communities of CSCW and IS. We identify similarities, but also stark differences between the two. The six identified issues of difference are the roles of theory, context, methodology, organizational layer, socio-technicality, and power-alignment. Our contribution is in making these differences visible. We hope this paper will promote diplomacy and understanding between these research communities, so that scholars may consider cross-disciplinary IS-CSCW publication strategies.",0
Adoption of UX evaluation in practice: An action research study in a software organization,"This paper describes an action research study focusing on adoption of UX and UX evaluation methods in a software organisation. The aim of adopting UX was to exceed a traditional approach to design of banking applications. The action research study involved collaboration over several months between the researchers and a group of developers with no prior knowledge of UX. The study demonstrates how UX methods can be introduced in an IT organisation and how UX decisions can be prioritised in the software industry. Focusing on understanding, supporting and improving the practice of the development team, we employed several adoption activities of UX evaluation methods by presenting these in a visual form (video records) and a practical form (workshops). Our results show that specific UX materials have been adopted in the development process of the IT department. Based on the study, we present our experience with adopting UX in an IT organisation with focus on the collaboration process, working with the UX definition, and the obstacles that occurred during the",0
Hierarchical Multi-tenancy in Business to Business Software Services,"The introduction of cloud computing has changed the provisioning and consumption of IT resources. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications provide functionality using internet connectivity and enable centralised management of executable code resources. Multi-tenancy is an architectural pattern for sharing a single instance of executable software while isolating the data and business process serving each tenant. In a multi-tenant application, a tenant is a logical grouping of end-users who share common code, data and process instances. Multi-tenancy can cut across all the layers of an application software architecture. Conventionally, multi-tenancy is implemented as a flat structure. All tenants are treated in the same way by application software. However, large enterprises are hierarchically organised with defined boundaries between business and functional units. A SaaS solution, aimed at large enterprise users, needs to reflect these hierarchical boundaries to eliminate duplication of functional software but enforce data and business process separation. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical multi-tenancy architecture for an enterprise-scale business-to-business (B2B) cloudhosted software service application. Organisational hierarchy plays a vital role in grouping end users into tenants and subtenants in our software. A new reference architectural style for implementing hierarchical multi-tenant application is presented here for the first time. We use a case study approach to empirically evaluate the latency of this architecture in comparison to known flat multitenancy patterns. Our experimental evaluation supports the hypothesis that the hierarchical multi-tenancy approach meets the needs of our application and improves its performance.",0

In action research, the ultimate objective is in the perceived functionality of chosen actions to produce desirable consequences for an organization.",0
Release cycle management: An action research study into a software company,"Software is increasingly developed in a recurrent fashion. Still, we lack theoretical knowledge and conceptual models for continuously improving software release management in such dynamic contexts. In response, we conducted an action research study to improve Software Inc.'s capability to recurrently release a specific software service, Secure-on-Request. Drawing on contextualist inquiry as theoretical frame, we addressed an initial problematic situation with a recent software acquisition, complexity of service delivery, new engineering and product management teams and low process maturity to improve the organisation's approach to software releases. As a result, we offer a detailed account of the process of, the content of and the context for transforming release management at Software Inc. through the phases of diagnosing, establishing, acting and learning. Based on these insights, we theorise release cycle management (RCM) as a key practice that integrates software process improvement into recurrent delivery of software. Moreover, we offer a conceptual model for RCM that software managers can use to implement such practices into their organisations.",0
Researching Dynamic Phenomena in Complex Organizations: Collaborative Practice Research with Theory Triangulation,"In this paper, we present a practice research strategy for collaboration with practitioners to execute valid and reliable research in the field while providing valuable, theory-based insight to practitioners who sponsor the research. This approach addresses the dual needs of researchers, who must gather data in real time and meet requirements of academic rigor, while maximizing the value and relevance of the work for practitioner collaborators. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of a Fortune 30 company undertaking an extensive organizational change initiative. During our 18-month research engagement with the company, we used a theory triangulation approach to guide our inquiry and analysis, iterating on emergent findings to articulate actionable recommendations for the practitioners working on the phenomena of interest. By describing our research design, we offer one method for framing 'real world' research in a way that maximizes the benefit to researchers and practitioners.",0
International Scientific Collaboration in Artificial Intelligence An Analysis Based on Web Data,"In this era of interdisciplinary science, Web science and artificial intelligence (AI), have brought dramatic revolutions to human society. The increasing availability of structured and unstructured information on the Web has become a critical research resource and offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the science of science (SciSci). SciSci use science technique to study the past, current, and evolving scientific discovery. Although many significant SciSci works study the patterns of international scientific collaboration, the relevant knowledge in AI is sorely lacking. In this work, we study the evolution of the international scientific collaboration patterns in the AI field. By graphing the entities and relationships in the international collaboration pattern, we make multiple multidimensional statistical analyses from the perspectives of institutions and countries.",0
How has agile methods inspired an industrywide project management initiative,"Increased complexity in projects has forced new project management initiatives. In software development several agile methods have emerged and methods such as Scrum are today highly implemented in practice. General project management practice has been inspired by agile software development. But in order to fully understand and to provide suggestions for future practice on how agility can be incorporated in general project management, this paper addresses how agile methods have inspired general project management practices. To answer the research question, the paper provides an analysis which compares ten characteristics of agile software development (identified in theory) and the general project management method developed by the Danish Project Half Double (PHD) initiative. The method consists of 10 leading stars (principles) and the impact, flow and leadership (IFL) method for rethinking project management. The analysis showed how general project management to a large degree has been conquered by agile methods.",0
Mobilising knowledge: an action design research case study of using technology to safeguard an endangered nature-based tourism attraction,"This paper considers how an Action Design Research (ADR) research methodology can contribute to impactful research in sustainable tourism. ADR arguably combines the best of Action Research with Design Science, by solving an applied problem within its contextual setting (a feature of Action Research) and drawing wider lessons or universal principles from the solution (a feature of Design Science). It argues that approaches like ADR are required to address what is a fundamentally goal-oriented (through the very definition of sustainable tourism) area of research, and bridge the academic-practitioner divide. The paper presents an ADR case study on using technology to build the eco-literacy of tourists visiting Australia?s Great Barrier Reef. This natural attraction represents a highly complex ecosystem, in an educationally challenging (underwater) environment, surrounded by political and scientific controversy. The case study involves the creation of a virtual reality interpretive game (the artefact) to illustrate the four stages of ADR, namely, Problem Formulation; Build, Intervene, Evaluate; Reflect and Learn; Formalise Learning. The case study highlights the importance of ADR?s principles of ?reciprocal shaping?, ?mutually influencing roles? and ?authentic and concurrent evaluation? to bridge the gap between practice and theory, and build impactful research that can support more sustainable tourism.",0
Ambidexterity and Entrepreneurship Studies: A Literature Review and Research Agenda,"Originated by an individual capacity, organizational ambidexterity represents how organizations do two different things equally well (i.e., efficiency and flexibility, adaptability and alignment, integration and responsiveness, or exploration and exploitation). The versatility of the ambidexterity concept allows using it to test multiple research questions from various perspectives. It explains that in the last decades, the research in organizational ambidexterity has been exponentially rising. The authors argued that the proliferation of papers represents a consolidation stage of any phenomenon. Therefore, in this development cycle, the two possibilities maybe its decline or re-focus along new lines. Although the publication pattern focused on strategic management journals, it does not mean that organizational ambidexterity is only observed in established and mature organizations? strategies. Several entrepreneurial organizations have been born (e.g., new ventures) or have rejuvenated (i.e., established ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation) by implementing and developing an organizational ambidexterity capacity. This study is motivated by the apparent unrepresentativeness of organizational ambidexterity in entrepreneurship studies. Therefore, (a) we look back to the past 15 years of published research by focusing on the contribution of organizational ambidexterity to the ?elds of management studies and entrepreneurship studies; and (b)we look forward to the research in organizational ambidexterity by inspiring the analysis of ambidexterity?s role in the current scenarios (social, economic, technological, environmental) in management and entrepreneurship studies. Based on this review and analysis, we show the underrepresentation of entrepreneurship in the published ambidexterity literature until the last decade (the 2010s). Motivated by this insight, we provoke the discussion about how the concept of ambidexterity, characterized by managing a double tension simultaneously, is a potential ingredient in the entrepreneurial decision-making process of individuals, teams, organizations, and eco-systems agents. We encourage new research lines that help refresh the analysis of ambidexterity in the entrepreneurship ?eld and re-thinking its contribution to the reconciliation process between management, innovation, and entrepreneurship ?elds. Furthermore, several implications to managers, entrepreneurial organizations, and entrepreneurs emerge from this study. Concretely, we encourage them to consider this approach as a way of thinking to face the current social, economic, and health problems that we are living in due to the COVID-19 pandemic effects.",0
"Innovation Processes in Indigenous Communities in the North-Cultural, Psychological and Technological Knowledge in Practice","The paper addresses psychological knowledge in innovation pro- cesses in rural areas in the North. The empirical base is the introduction of an innovation program realized through the University of the Arctic, a cooperative network of universities, colleges and other organizations committed to higher education and research in the North. We attempted to stimulate innovation in the rural villages of Northern Russia using workshops centred on building social capital through psychological knowledge. Our analysis shows that good family health and psychological knowledge among villagers is important for sustaining the innovation process in the North. We also found that technological infras- tructure is a crucial but often lacking component in this process.",0
Contextualizing Competence And Learning For Industry 4.0,"Industrial work is under restructuring due to digitalization and automation. Technological leaps have led to paradigm shifts, and today with increased digitalization many companies are facing Industry 4.0 through disruptive technologies. Through smarter industrial solutions such as Internet of Things (IoT), interconnected machines enable continuous data production and interaction with their environment in new ways. Not only through robots, but also through all types of digital devices - which require some form of information interpretation as well as human operation and interaction. The human role in such ""technology-talking"" work situation will affect the decision-making and business operation processes. Also work incentives and the provision of knowledge creation will form work-training models in the industry 4.0 companies? operations. Hence, increased digitalization pushes competence development of workers and employees, and to be organized as an integrated combination of engineering knowledge and practical skills. In what way will digitalization in general and IoT in particular change industrial work and its conditions for competence development and learning? This question is asked and contextualized in two industrial cases, which represent different instances of production lines that is now undergoing industry 4.0. The findings are based on empirical data collections through interviews, observations as well as field- and meeting notes. Early results show that the advancements of digital technologies need to go hand in hand with competence development approaches. The findings show how industry 4.0 initiatives are perceived and adopted by various stakeholder groups. Interviewed managers are stressing the increased need of digitalized data and immediate decision support. As new work conditions based on software-oriented and data-driven initiatives emerge, new learning logics are needed. From these various ?pictures? of Industry 4.0 initiatives we contribute with a discussion about prerequisites and implications for competence and learning for industry 4.0 transformations.",0
Management Strategies For Knowledge Transformation: A Study Of Learning Effects In Industry-Union-University Collaborative E-Learning Initiatives,"Competence development on academic level is a key factor for industries in times of increased digitalization of manufacturing work. To develop competitive manufacturing requires employees with expert knowledge. Even if individual employees? motivation for learning is essential, management need to put efforts on competence development and encourage education that, combine theory and practice in forms of work-integrated learning. Blended e-learning courses on university level has been successful for supporting such competence development needs, which here is described as work- integrated e-learning, e-WIL. In this study, we explore practitioners? knowledge transformation after their participation in blended e-WIL courses that are designed with industry target content aiming for workplace transformation. Specifically, we focus on the learning efforts versus the management strategies after e-learning initiatives that have an effect on workplace transformations. The industry target courses are designed in collaboration between an industry-union-university venture of a Norwegian industry network, the Addisco union and a Swedish university. Six courses are included comprising three course subjects; Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Engineering Tools, and Robotics and Automation. Addisco was the facilitator for engaging industry-university collaboration, and stimulated co-creation between industry companies. Data was collected through a longitudinal action research project, comprising six focus group sessions with 113 industry participants during 2015 and 2018. We analysed the company management support of knowledge transformation through the course participants? experiences after the course interventions. Overall results show that most participants experience a low management support of knowledge transformation as an engine for workplace transformation, after conducting e-WIL courses. Stimulation of individual motivation and new skills gained were not promoted within the workplace structures. There seem to be a lack of individual competence plans, time for studies, business models and routines, networking and recognition of the individuals? knowledge transformation. Rather, participants claimed individual responsibilities, and motivation that drives them to competence development. We therefore argue for stronger management awareness and to develop company strategies that fully appreciate the added values and new knowledge that industry participants bring back after course participation.",0
Evaluating an emergency management decision support system with practitioner-driven scenarios: action design research,"Evaluating an IT artifact is essential in design science, as it serves to validate that a solution has achieved the purpose for which it was designed. This paper presents the evaluation of an emergency management (EM) decision support system (DSS). The DSS addresses the informational needs of strategic-level decision makers in the event of large-scale disasters. Disasters, by their very nature, are complex and unpredictable, require emergency responders to make rapid high risk decisions with the potential for life threatening and economically devastating results. This study details a phased evaluation using three scenarios: (1) Biological Hazard Response, (2) Cross-Border Chemical Explosion and Bio-Hazard, and (3) Regional and Interregional Mass Flooding. The mixed method evaluation elicited participant feedback to test usability and utility, guided by action design research. To ensure parity between scenarios, an existing EM framework informed scenario design with the unique addition of the DSS to support end-user processes.",0
ASSESSMENT OF INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE: SPANISH VERSION THE AITCS SCALE,"The current organizations, characterized by its globally, complexity, connectivity and interculturality need of Collaboration between its members. This collaboration gives answers to the organizational requirements as well the psychosocial needs of the persons that interact in order to achieve emotional wellbeing and continuous learning both at the individual as the collective level. After a review of the literature, has been identify the concept Interprofessional Collaborative Practice ICP and has been selected a tool for its assessment Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS) developed by Orchard, et al. (2012). This instrument originally developed for the health field has been adapted to broad the organizational context and translated to the Spanish. Methods: This new version of the scale, with 37 items on a 5-point Likert scale, was administered to 507 students. Results: The Spanish version of the AITCS included three subscales: Partnership (21 items), Cooperation (11 items) and Coordination (5 items). Its overall reliability was 0.954, which accounted for a variance of 50.1%. The internal consistency of the reliability of each subscale was estimated to range between 0.724 and 0.921. Some differences between the factor structure of the AITCS and of this new version were identified, but they do not affect the conclusion that it is a reliable and valid instrument. Discussion: The psychometric analysis of the Spanish version of the AITCS has proven it to be a valid and reliable instrument.",0
Work-integrated learning as an outcome of using action design research in practice,"This paper highlights Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) as an outcome of using Action Design Research (ADR) in practice. We argue that ADR is a subtype of Design Science Research (DSR) and a prominent method for facilitating mutually beneficial collaboration between academia and practice. Subsequently, we tie our work around ADR and WIL to the Scandinavian school of IS-research and worker participation, by emphasizing reflective practice on both researcher and practitioner side. We demonstrate this through two empirical cases and four case episodes. Consequently, the cases highlight building, intervention, and evaluation in the areas of civic orientation and county administration. The narrative around each case focuses on ADR-activities that mediate reflection and learning through iterative cycles. Outcomes from the cases are reported as WIL-outcomes and finally, we conclude this paper by briefly suggesting two implications for future relevant research.",0
How to Realize Business Value through a Big Data Analytics Capability--Results from an Action Design Research Approach,"Big data analytics (BDA) has been proven to be a source for business value in organizations. Though the notion of capabilities is often used to explain business value realization, the process from BDA-related organizational investments into business value is not yet fully understood. To address this gap in research, we draw on an action design research approach to delineate this process by drawing on a real-world setting as well as the prevalent body of knowledge. As a result, we propose a process model including two sub-processes: (1) the BDA conversion process, which explains the steps between BDA- related investments to resources, and (2) the BDA synergy process, which delineates the step from a BDA capability towards business value realization. Via taking this holistic perspective, we go first steps towards a nascent design theory in BDA business value realization, providing a basis for future IS research.",0
Improving the Impact of Big Data Analytics Projects With Benefits Dependency Networks,"Big data analytics is regarded as the next frontier in creating digital opportunities for businesses. An- alytics projects rarely deliver the intended benefits for the organisation that invest in these data ana- lytics, and currently, no widely accepted design method for analytics projects exists. To address this, we report from an action research project in an organisation highly involved with big data analytics and how benefits materialize from these projects through the practices of tailored and focused benefits management. We argue for using the benefits dependency network for orchestrating commitment to benefits. Benefits dependency networks create linkages between analytics technology, organisational change activities, stakeholders? interests and to-be benefits of a project. With this study, we contribute with: (1) a tailored technique for benefits dependency networks, (2) focus on benefits into established project development practices for big data analytics (3) facilitation as a key capability in developing a benefits dependency network.",0
Bridging Design Thinking and EntreComp for Entrepreneurship Workshops: A Learning Experience,"Design Thinking (DT) is commonly used in Entrepreneurship Education, however it?s capacity to support entrepreneurial competencies has not been explored sufficiently. In this study, we used a multi-method approach to gain an in-depth understanding of participants? learning journeys in two early entrepreneurship events. These were structured around DT and specifically IDEO?s implementation of Human Centred Design (HCD). Through semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation we were able to link the stages of HCD to specific competencies and identify competencies that manifest across the wider process. We draw conclusions on the contribution of DT in the development of these competencies and make suggestions for using EntreComp to add nuance to DT interventions. Finally we discuss the impact of facilitation, professionalism, customization and logistical factors on the success of DT interventions.",0
'Let's not reinvent the wheel': A qualitative investigation of collaboration in the Australian GP education and training sector,"Introduction: E-learning collaboration in the Australian GP education and training sector represents one way to improve sustainability, innovation and reuse of existing data sources. However, few collaborative e-learning projects are currently undertaken within the sector, with previous joint ventures resulting in variable success. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of increased e-learning collaboration, with specific focus on exploration of the beliefs and perceptions of key stakeholders within the GP education and training sector. <br /><br />Methods: A total of 78 personnel and 16 CEOs participated in focus groups and interviews held at training sites across Australia. Independent and group qualitative analysis was used to derive key themes. <br /><br />Results: Six key themes related to e-learning collaboration were identified: benefits of e-learning collaboration, maintaining focus on educational outcomes, competitiveness within the RTP sector, individual identity and regional differences, establishing relationships and enablers to promoting collaboration. <br /><br />Conclusions: Considerable goodwill and enthusiasm towards collaboration exists within the sector. Congruent with established literature regarding collaboration, key recommendations are detailed for the advancement of prospective collaborative e-learning projects, including a need for early and ongoing stakeholder engagement, a focus on educational outcomes, respect for matters of individual identity and consideration of regional differences.",0
Learning to be a Platform Owner: How BMW Enhances App Development for Cars,"Platform owners face multiple challenges such as onboarding and orchestrating app developers as well as providing resources to enable the development of complementary apps. Information systems research considers digital platform governance as key to address these challenges. Thereby, the focus lies on the relationship of a platform owner and app developers. However, while there is evidence how app developers acquire skills through these interactions, there is limited knowledge of how platform owners benefit from interacting with app developers to improve their digital platforms. To address this gap, in this article, we study the emergence of a digital platform for automotive onboard apps within the BMW Group. Our results are grounded in 30 expert interviews that we conducted during a period of two years and are enriched by extensive secondary data. We identify transfer of perspective, transfer of knowledge, and transfer of artifacts as basic mechanisms that enable a platform owner to enhance its digital platform. The inherent improvements of the digital platform facilitate the app development. Our work extends the existing theory on platform emergence and provides insights into the learning process of an inexperienced platform owner. Our findings reveal valuable recommendations for organizations that are struggling to establish digital platforms.",0
An Integrated Model for Strategizing with the Base of the Pyramid: An Action Research into a Mexican Agribusiness,"The Base of the Pyramid (BOP) strategy is an important opportunity for the world?s private sector to create new business opportunities while at the same time helping address and alleviate poverty. However, while the literature describes several cases, we still have limited knowledge about the process through which managers engage in BOP strategizing. This article provides a detailed account of how a Mexican agribusiness: Agroservicios Nacionales, SAPI de CV (ANSA) developed and implemented a BOP strategy to co-create value with its distributors and poor corn farmers. In doing so, it created a new, franchise-based business entity, AgroEstacion, to strengthen its position in the market and within the industry as a leader in BOP business practices. Drawing on Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) and Option-Driven Strategizing (ODS), we adopted action research to establish close collaboration among the firm?s top directors, a select group of its managers, designated local distributors, and the researcher. As a result, we offer an Integrated Model that firms can use to strategize BOP opportunities in a way that benefits both their business and the surrounding society. To illustrate the model, we present a detailed account of the strategizing process at ANSA, how AgroEstacion was conceived, how it was implemented, and the outcomes and experiences of the overall strategizing process. In conclusion, we draw on the empirical findings and extant theory to offer principles for application of the Integrated Model to strategize BOP",0
Research Perspectives: Improving Action Research by Integrating Methods,"Action research (AR) has developed extensively since the 1970s. We reviewed the AR literature within the information systems (IS) discipline and found 16 different methods, which constitutes a problematic situation for researchers. We describe and critique those methods before integrating their strengths to improve the AR method that is most frequently practiced in IS: canonical action research (CAR). The existing set of principles and criteria for CAR is modified and elaborated to enhance the foundation for undertaking AR consistently. We discuss the general implications of this improved form of the method, which we name integrated action research (IAR). We specifically suggest how IAR can be used to investigate the application of disruptive technologies, including those that embody artificial intelligence and enable more flexible and socially distanced work.",0
Educating the Global Maritime Professional?A case of collaborative e-learning,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new educational approach responding to the needs of new areas of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in maritime education and training (MET) as set forth in the recently published Global Maritime Professional initiative (IAMU 2019). In particular, this study explores the development of a collaborative e-learning approach targeting young maritime professionals coming together from different MET institutions. An action research process has been employed, where faculty, administrators, and students from four MET institutions participated to understand evolving educational needs and the need for new educational approaches. Based on the outcome, a new collaborative e-learning approach was tested and evaluated with students from the MET institutions. The findings give evidence of new educational needs in MET concerning leadership, teamwork, communication, cultural awareness, and new technology applications. The results point toward how collaboration is needed to infuse new topical expertise to MET institutions and to enable students (and instructors) to increase collaboration, including the importance of socialization between students from different MET institutions; how it is possible to develop new dynamic e-learning materials to give students access to new topic expertise; and the provisions of application and analytical learning activities with an e-learning educational approach. MET institutions are under pressure to develop new educational topics and approaches. At the same time, they are experiencing resource constraints and tend to operate in isolation. The results of this study provide a route forward as to how MET institutions can come together to develop new forms of education using the latest e-learning educational methods and technologies.",0
IT-Based Revenue Cycle Management: An Action Research into Relational Coordination,"Many US hospitals are finding it extremely challenging to maintain their financial health as they are operating with consistently thinning margins. Administrative inefficiencies in Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) diminish cash flow, reducing crucial capital investments urgently needed to improve health outcomes. Whereas IS research increasingly focuses on the promises and challenges of clinical IT, few studies have explored the role of IT in addressing the information sharing and coordination challenges related to RCM in hospitals. Motivated by this gap, we adopt relational coordination theory to analyze three successful IT-driven interventions into a hospital's RCM. Our action research provides insights into how IT can help improve hospitals' financial viability and it demonstrates how relational coordination theory can help understand IT-enabled process innovations. The findings are important to both practitioners and scholars interested in exploring how the nexus of work relationships and technology can improve organizational outcomes.",0
A hybrid RSA-DH cipher for Signed Encrypted Messages,"Although brute-force attacks on the modulus component of the RSA algorithm are possible, increasing the key size frustrates perpetrators more. However large keys increase CPU and Memory usage. Key handling would also be a challenge. Alternative approaches for strengthening the RSA algorithm are required. In addition, verification of message sources is not a feature of the RSA algorithm. Message senders cannot be tracked. If the RSA algorithm is to be used commercially, sender verification is necessary. The two drawbacks to commercial use of the RSA algorithm are, therefore, possibilities of attacks and lack of sender verification. The DH algorithm allows secure transmission of codes over insecure public channels. Can RSA encrypted messages be ?signed? using DH generated codes? Can concatenation of DH codes and RSA encrypted messages detour brute force attacks while, at the same time, allowing message verification? We propose the design of a hybrid RSA-DH algorithm which signed encrypted messages are shared. The hybrid version satisfies most properties of good cryptosystems: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability. The results reported (CPU and memory usage) show negligible differences in the relative performance of the hybrid and ordinary versions, even when the hybrid version combines the processes of two algorithms.",0
Scientists' involvement in partnership for generation and dissemination of horticultural technologies and innovation in Africa,"Inadequacy of research facilities and human capital in horticultural research for development in Africa can be addressed through partnership, networking and social capital development. This study was embarked upon to determine the extent of involvement of researchers in Africa in south-south partnerships for generation and dissemination of horticultural technologies and innovation for development. Three out of the 14 proceedings of symposia and conferences organized by the International Society for Horticultural Science held in Africa which addressed general horticulture between 2010 and 2015 (Acta Horticulturae 911, 1007 and 1021) were purposively sampled. 227 published articles in the proceedings were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Many (42.7%) of the scientists had partnership with 2-3 people. Most (87.2%) of the lead scientists were from Africa. They partnered with other researchers from Africa only (67.0%), Africa and Europe (6.2%) and Europe only (4.9%). Intra-institutional partnership within the same country accounted for 58.2% while same country inter-institutional partnership accounted for 24.7%. Commodities of research focus were fruits (27.8%) and vegetables (17.6%) while subject matter of research was socio-economics (34.8%) and others (43.7%). There were significant relationships between researchers' involvement in partnership formation and their affiliation (?2=64.9, p=0.00), commodity of research focus (?2=24.4, p=0.02), subject matter of research (?2=24.8, p=0.00), continent of first author (?2=23.2, p=0.03), and continent of other authors (?2=284.0, p=0.00). Researchers in Africa need to network and partner more with researchers from advanced economies to boost horticultural research for development and improvement of livelihood in the continent.",0
Applying Action Design Research ({ADR}) to Develop Collaboration Virtual Programming Laboratory as Supporting System For Student Centered Learning,"The development of technology is currently growing very rapidly. The change of information and communication technology (ICT) to ubiquitous technology is inevitable. This affects the development of the world of education, where the current learning method that is being promoted by the government is a student-based learning system or known as the Student Centered Learning (SCL). ADR is one of Information systems design science research frameworks. To produce a perspective design of knowledge through four main stages: Problem Formulation, Building Intervention and Evaluation (BIE), Reflection and Learning, Formalization of Learning, ADR is a combination of Action Research (AD) with Design Science Research (DSR). In learning of programming required laboratory infrastructure that can support in terms of programming practice. Growth of learning students is not aligned with the extension of supporting infrastructure, in this case the laboratory, especially the programming laboratory. In a case study at Widyatama University, along with the change of teaching and learning system, the learning media also changed. The current learning media that is e-learning, can only support theoretical learning but not support for learning in practice. This project is done by two domains: Teaching Learning Office (TLO) as the department that responsible for current e-learning, and An informatics study center developing a virtual laboratory. At the evaluation stage, testing is qualitative for users, as well as testing in Alpha and Betha. Alpha testing is done intranet on VPL-SCM, whereas on Betha testing done internet on VPL_SCM. Conclusion is an important aspect when designing IT artifacts is the dynamics between plan design and use context, The ADR interaction focuses on researchers, practitioners and end users during the design process and is strongly collaborative-oriented, The evaluation stage in ADR is a continuous stage, so the development of IT artefac can be continuously adjusted through repeatable processes, so virtual programming laboratory can be implemented properly as a supporter of existing e-learning system.",0
A tailored participatory action research for foss communities,"Participatory Action Research (PAR) is an established method to implement change in organizations. However, it cannot be applied in the open source (FOSS) communities, without adaptation to their particularities, especially to the specific control mechanisms developed in FOSS. FOSS communities are self-managed, and rely on consensus to reach decisions. This study proposes a PAR framework specifically tailored to FOSS communities. We successfully applied the framework to implement a set of quality assurance interventions in the Robot Operating System community. The framework we proposed is composed of three components, interventions design, democratization, and execution. We believe that this process will work for other FOSS communities too. We have learned that changing a particular aspect of a FOSS community is arduous. To achieve success the change must rally the community around it for support and attract motivated volunteers to implement the interventions.",0
Problematizing in IS design research,"This paper is based on the interest to see how problems are addressed in information systems design research. Problems addressed by design research are often implicit, sometimes open, and sometimes even underdeveloped. Problem-solving processes, action research and in a broader sense, engaged scholarship all encompass the explicit addressing of problems and investigation problem situations. Such a problem-orientation is to a lesser degree part of design research. In this paper, we will investigate how we can provide a better understanding of problematizing in design research; and in particular what we may learn from other approaches with a stronger problem-orientation.",0
Information systems in India: Dare to cross,"The pluralistic nature of the information systems discipline can hardly be exaggerated. Yet, there is an increasing tendency to engage in debates on the need for a more emphatic identity. Such debates are often grounded in the questions of our contribution to praxis, disciplinary evolution and the larger socio-economic context that we thrive in. One such socio-economic context, where the information technology industry has been acknowledged to have made a notable contribution to the global arena, is India. The evolution of the Indian IT industry offers some interesting insights on the role played by and the nature of contributions from different stakeholders, including software firms, educational institutions, client firms ? especially from the developed countries, the Indian diaspora and the Government of India. We use traces of this history to understand the mutual influence of the Indian academia, chiefly in the management information systems discipline and the Indian IT industry. The four dominant roles that the information systems academia have played in shaping the industry include visioning, incubating, generating knowledge and building capacity. The time has come for us to consolidate these roles and strengthen our position by daring to cross boundaries, drawing from the intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of information systems. We call upon information systems academia, especially in developing countries like India, to engage in transdisciplinary thematic research areas, be more inclusive through membership and collaborative agenda setting and build institutions that foster interdisciplinarity.",0
Exploring Opportunities with Experimental Use of Communicative Spaces to Overcome Defensive Routines and Increase Information Systems Utilization,"Both organizations and the information technology (IT) community have long worked to overcome the common problem of dissatisfaction with IT investments? outcomes in multiple ways. Much attention has been on users? involvement in IT design, while users? engagement in later further utilization of IT is less explored. This paper reports on action research (AR) that sought to stimulate local learning processes and increase the exploitation of a case-handling system. The experiment is done in a county administration where the senior management has, for some time, felt that the IT is not fully utilized. The local intervention was based on an awareness of a need to overcome defensive routines to establish communicative spaces to facilitate communication between various units with strong local identities. The AR project was carried out in three local interventions and presented as an experimental approach. We could not guarantee that the design could overcome the issues identified after the first round of interviews with senior management and department managers. The intervention process espoused various defensive routines, even some that the communicative space approach could not overcome. The outcomes from the three experiments are, therefore, mixed. The results indicate that creating communicative spaces is a viable approach to engaging users in systems development. Nevertheless, defensive routines, reluctant managers, and communities of practices hamper the development of communicative spaces.",0
Analysis and Design Web Based System in LPPM UMN,"Institute for Research and Community Service, or called LPPM is a forum for researchers to conduct studies with internal and national scales. LPPM UMN is one of the institutions that provide the container for UMN researchers. However, in the LPPM UMN itself still does not have a webbased system that can be accessed anywhere. This website will be able to share knowledge amongst lecturers by downloading study results that have been done before. After collecting all the requirements, an application is designed using the Rapid Application Development for a limited time spent. The application is built by designing a website and applying MySQL database and PHP programming language with CodeIgniter framework 2.2.2. This website is divided into 3 parts; admins, reviewers, and researcher. Admins are able to see the whole proposal which is sent and appoint a reviewer for one of the proposals. Reviewers have some facilities to review research proposals that have been uploaded. Researchers are able to upload a research proposal.",0
A Model for Technology Transfer in Practice,Successful technology transfer requires close cooperation and collaboration between researchers and practitioners. Researchers need to observe the challenges facing industry firsthand and tailor their work accordingly. Practitioners can help shape technology development on the basis of tangible issues identified on site. This article presents a seven-step technology transfer model that reflects collaborations between university researchers and practitioners at two Swedish companies. The authors discuss key lessons learned for each of these seven steps.,1
Action Research as a Model for Industry-Academia Collaboration in the Software Engineering Context,"Background: Action research is a well-established research methodology. It is following a post-positivist research philosophy grounded in critical thinking. The methodology is driven by practical problems, emphasis participatory research, and develops practically useful solutions in an iterative manner.Objective: Two objectives are to be achieved: (1) Understanding the state of the art with respect to action research usage in the software engineering literature, and (2) reflecting and providing recommendations of how to foster industry-academia collaboration through action research. Method: Based on our experience with two action research studies in close collaboration with Ericsson lessons learned and guidelines are presented.Results: In both cases presented action research led to multiple refinements in the interventions implemented. Furthermore, the close collaboration and co-production with the industry was essential to identify and describe the required refinements to provide an in-depth understanding. In comparison with previous studies, we required multiple iterations while previous software engineering studies reported mostly one iteration, or were not explicit regarding the number of iterations studied.Conclusion: We conclude that action research is a powerful tool for industry-academia collaboration. The success of the method highly depends on the researchers and practitioners working in a team. Future studies need to improve the reporting with respect to describing the type of action research used, the iterations, the model of collaboration, and the rationales for changes in each iteration.",1
Agile Collaborative Research: Action Principles for Industry-Academia Collaboration,"Both the software industry and academia promote collaboration to solve challenges together that neither can solve alone. Collaboration brings opportunities to understand and improve in ways not possible when working apart, but it succeeds only if both parties are contributing. A collaboration model developed from eight years' experience setting up and managing a research center explicitly focused on industry needs is based on five success factors enabling research results (need orientation, industry goal alignment, deployment impact, industry benefit, and innovativeness), five success factors enabling research activities (management engagement, network access, collaborator match, communication ability, and continuity), and 10 action principles for industry-academia collaboration management.",1
Academia Industry Collaboration: Getting Closer is the Key!,"Our greatest developers in industry do not typically view top researchers in academia as people who they can learn particularly much from, and our top researchers in academia do not typically view top developers as people who can contribute much to their research (except supply them with raw data). While researchers have spent years on post-university studies to learn the profession of data collection, data analysis, and data sensemaking, developers are trained to produce and deliver in time based on current best thinking. Taking different paths after the university studies soon ends up in different governing variables for developers and researchers of what brings value. This is a well-known phenomenon, and numerous articles and books are describing why this is the case (Barnes et al., Eur Manag J 20(3):272-285, 2002; Mathiassen, Inf Technol People 14(4):321-345, 2002; Mora-Valentin et al., Res Policy 33(1):17-40, 2004; Gorschek et al., IEEE Softw 23(6):88-95, 2006; Rombach and Achatz, Research collaboration between academia and industry. In: Proc. Future of Software Eng. (FOSE 07), IEEE CS Press, pp. 29-36, 2007; Van den Ven, Engaged Scholarship: A Guide for Organizational and Social Research. Oxford Univ. Press, 2007). In the Software Center we have found practical ways on how to make developers and researchers appreciate the same values and by that join forces to solve complex software engineering issues. A key instrument is to get close on all levels from steering groups to reference groups and research teams. In the following chapter, we describe how we in the Software Center work in practice to stimulate a close collaboration and what is required to make this work over time.",1
Software engineering technology innovation Turning research results into industrial success,"This paper deals with the innovation of software engineering technologies. These technologies are methods and tools for conducting software development and maintenance. We consider innovation as a process consisting of two phases, being technology creation and technology transfer. In this paper, we focus mainly on the transfer phase. Technology transfer is of mutual interest to both academia and industry. Transfer is important for academia, because it shows the industrial relevance of their research results to, for example, their sponsoring authorities. Showing the industrial applicability of research results is sometimes referred to as valorization of research. Nowadays, valorization is often required by research funding bodies. The transfer is important for industries, because innovating their development processes and their products is supportive in gaining a competitive edge or remaining competitive in their business. We describe the technology transfer phase by means of three activities: technology evaluation, technology engineering, and technology embedding. The technology evaluation activity is perceived as the main gate between the technology creation phase and the technology transfer phase. With two case studies, originating from the Dutch high-tech systems industry, we will illustrate the activities in the transfer phase. In addition to the process we will also define the main roles in a software engineering technology innovation, namely: the technology provider (academic research, industrial research and technology vendor) and the technology receiver (industrial development). With those roles we also address the issues concerning the ownership of technologies.",1
Industrial Impact and Lessons Learned,"The Darwin project carried out research on evolvability in an industrial setting. This chapter discusses the results transferred to the industrial party of the project: Philips Healthcare MRI. Our discussion about the industrial impact of the project pays attention to the highlights in transfer in the four areas of the Darwin research on evolvability, namely: mining, mechanisms, reference architecture and economic decision making. Several of the research results are currently being used by Philips Healthcare MRI. In this chapter, we reflect on the project and summarize the results. First, the industrial impact of the Darwin results is discussed. Second, twelve factors are presented to identify the transfer of the Darwin results to industry. Third an overview of activities, as well as the different kinds of project meetings, to conduct an Industry-as-Laboratory project is described. All this results in a set of lessons learned for the Industry-as-Laboratory research paradigm",1
Observations from the Industry-as-Laboratory Research Project Darwin 1,"In 1993, Potts observed that research done using the research-then-transfer paradigm failed to influence industrial practice. Potts advocated that by applying the industry-as-laboratory paradigm, research can make a significant practical difference. Darwin is an industry-as-laboratory research project that is almost finished. In this article, we describe observations and evidence from the Darwin project related to Potts? hypothesis. Furthermore, we describe observed challenges in our industry-as-laboratory research project, together with how we addressed them.",1
Conducting empirical studies in industry: Balancing rigor and relevance,"Empirical Software Engineering research has achieved considerable results in building our knowledge about selecting and applying appropriate empirical methods for technology evaluation. Empirical studies in general and empirical studies in industrial settings in particular have played an important role in successful transition of many Software Engineering technologies to industry, for example, defect detection techniques and automated test cases. However, conducting empirical research in industrial settings remains a challenging undertaking for a variety of reasons. There is no substantial literature reporting on the challenges and complexities involved in conducting empirical studies in an industry in general and in settings whose business models are built around global sourcing. This paper reports some of our experiences and lessons learned from conducting empirical research in industry. Some of the observed challenges include short time horizon for research, high expectations, limited research skills, and the ?acceptable? research rigor. The paper discusses some of these issues with relevant examples and provides some strategies for overcoming these issues. We also stress that researchers and practitioners should share their experiences of conducting empirical research in order to help build a body of knowledge to guide the future efforts.",1
Tool-driven technology transfer to support software architecture decisions,"Software architecture design decisions are key drivers for the success of software systems. Despite awareness for their criticality, software architects often rationalize and document their decisions poorly. On this behalf, ABB Corporate Research initiated a technology transfer project to integrate an architecture decision framework from the University of Groningen into ABB software development processes. The project involved close communication between university researchers, industry researchers, and ABB software architects and resulted in the implementation of a plug-in for the UML tool Enterprise Architect. This paper summarizes success factors for the technology transfer, such as strong buy-in from the stakeholders, short feedback cycles, and seamless integration into existing tool-chains.",1
Conducting a long-term case study in a software firm: An experience report,"Academia and industry have been collaborating for over a century in different formats, including research projects' funds, commercialization of academic knowledge, academic consultancy in industrial projects, etc. Yet, academic researchers face various difficulties and challenges when performing research in industry. In this paper we describe several challenges we faced during a long-term case study research we performed in collaboration with a global IT firm. We present each challenge including its illustration in the context of our case study, describe the actions taken in the attempt to meet it, and discuss lessons learned.",1
Sustainable Technology Transfer,"In this position paper we address the issue of transferring a technology from research into an industrial organization by presenting a refined process for technology transfer. Based on over two decades of industrial experience, we identified the need for a dedicated technology engineering phase for that process. Although little attention has been paid to this technology engineering phase in the academic world, we believe it to be essential for sustainable technology transfer.",1
3-Step Knowledge Transition: A Case Study on Architecture Evaluation,"Software Engineering is developing very fast. To keep up with the changes, software companies need effective methods of knowledge transfer. In the paper a 3-step approach to knowledge transfer, called Technical Drama, is presented. The paper is focused on transferring knowledge concerning architecture evaluation, but the approach could also be applied to transferring knowledge concerning inspections, testing etc. It is claimed in the paper that the Technical Drama can be useful in the industrial context (two case studies are described) as well as at university (then a kind of software studio is required).",1
Is Action Research the Path to a Solid Research Culture in IS/SE for Costa Rica?,"In Latin America there is a visible evidence of lack of research initiatives and a strong disassociation between Academia and Industry in the areas of Information Systems and Software Engineering. Despite the potential of Latin America, such situations hinder the opportunity to build up the required knowledge in order to participate competitively in the international market, holding back the possibility of a technology-based economy in these countries. We propose action research as a flexible and plausible research schema for bridging the gaps between Academia and Industry and at the same time promoting a research culture in Latin America (more specifically in the Costa Rican context), considering the current needs of the Industry and the current directions that have been taken by the Academia for performing research in Information Systems and Software Engineering.",1
Empirical software engineering research with industry: Top 10 challenges,"Software engineering research can be done in many ways, in particular it can be done in different ways when it comes to working with industry. This paper presents a list of top 10 challenges to work with industry based on our experience from working with industry in a very close collaboration with continuous exchange of knowledge and information. The top 10 list is based on a large number of research projects and empirical studies conducted with industrial research partners since 1983. It is concluded that close collaboration is a long-term undertaking and a large investment. The importance of addressing the top 10 challenges is stressed, since they form the basis for a long-term sustainable and successful collaboration between industry and academia.",1
Enablers and Impediments for Collaborative Research in Software Testing: An Empirical Exploration,"When it comes to industrial organizations, current collaboration efforts in software engineering research are very often kept in-house, depriving these organizations of the skills necessary to build independent collaborative research. The current trend, towards empirical software engineering research, requires certain standards to be established which would guide these collaborative efforts in creating a strong partnership that promote independent, evidence-based, software engineering research. This paper examines key enabling factors for an efficient and effective industry-academia collaboration in the software testing domain. A major finding of the research was that while technology is a strong enabler to better collaboration, it must be complemented with industrial openness to disclose research results and the use of a dedicated tooling platform. We use as an example an automated test generation approach that has been developed in the last two years collaboratively with Bombardier Transportation AB in Sweden.",1
Finding Relevant Research Solutions for Practical Problems: The Serp Taxonomy Architecture,"Background: Experience and research indicates that there exist a communication gap between research and industry in software engineering.Objective: We propose the Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP) taxonomy architecture to support communication between practitioners and researchers. The taxonomy architecture provides a basis for classifying research from a problem perspective which in turn supports the breaking down of complex practical challenges to researchable units. Thus such taxonomy may support the mapping of challenges in industry to research solutions in the software engineering context.Method: In this paper we present SERP and exemplifies its usage based on two literature studies in the field of software engineering. Further, we discuss how a taxonomy based on this architecture could have helped us in two past research projects that were conducted in close collaboration with industry. Finally we validate SERP by applying it to the area of software testing, developing SERP-test, and interviewing two industry practitioners and two researchers.Results: The taxonomy architecture has been applied to two problems in software testing, and has been assessed through interviews with practitioners and researchers. The interviews provided suggestions of how to improve the taxonomy architecture, which have been incorporated. With two examples, we demonstrated how the taxonomy architecture could be used to find solutions for industrial problems, and to find the problems addressed by a particular solution.Conclusion: SERP may be useful in multiple ways: (1) Given that SERP taxonomies are populated with industrial problems and scientific solutions, we could rapidly identify candidate research solutions for industrial practice. (2) Researchers could benefit from the taxonomy in the reporting of their research to ease the mapping to industrial challenges.",1
Foundations for Long-Term Collaborative Research,Collaborative research between academia and industry is considered by many the perfect combination of expertise. The strong academic theoretical background is perfectly complemented by the applied knowledge of the industry. Yet we see many collaborative projects that fail to deliver the intended results. We believe that long-term collaboration should be based on foundations that ensure its success. In this paper we aim at defining those foundations by reflecting on the successful collaborative research projects we achieved.,1
Get the Cogs in Synch: Time Horizon Aspects of Industry--Academia Collaboration,"In industry--academia collaboration projects, there are many issues related to different time horizons in industry and academia. If not adressed upfront, they may hinder collaboration in such projects. We analyze our experiences from a 10 year industry--academia collaboration program, the EASE Industrial Excellence Center in Sweden, and identify issues and feasible practices to overcome the hurdles of different time horizons. Specifically, we identify issues related to contracts, goals, results, organization (in)stability, and work practices. We identify several areas where the time horizon is different, and conclude that mutual awareness of these differences and management commitment to the collaboration are the key means to overcome the differences. The launch of a mediating institute may also be part of the solution.",1
Fraunhofer: the German model for applied research and technology transfer,"The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft e.V. in Germany is Europe's largest and most successful organization for applied research and technology transfer. Its 48 institutes cover all areas of technology and engineering, ranging from materials and production technology to information and communication technology and solar energy. The Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in Kaiserslautern, Germany, focuses on software engineering methods, software product and process management, and learning organization concepts for software. It applies an experiment- or feedback-based transfer model, which has led to many successful and sustained improvements in the industrial practice of software development. In this paper, the underlying transfer model, key business areas and core competencies of Fraunhofer IESE, as well as examples of industrial transfer projects are illustrated. The presentation concludes with arguments as to why this transfer approach is well-suited for software development and why it is a prerequisite for the professionalization of software development.",1
Guidelines on Conducting Software Process Improvement Studies in Industry,"Initiating and conducting empirical case studies in industry are non-trivial tasks. There are many pitfalls, and many researchers have failed in their research. For example, there is the risk that the results are not particularly useful for the IT organization. As a result, the IT organization will be reluctant to cooperate with the researchers again. The purpose of this paper is to share the authors' experience and lessons learnt in conducting empirical case studies within software process improvement in cooperation with industry. In particular, we focus on the potential conflicts between the organizational goals and the research goals. Our experiences are summarized in terms of guidelines that we believe are useful for researchers in this area.",1
It Takes Two to Tango -- An Experience Report on Industry -- Academia Collaboration,"Industry - academia collaboration is critical for empirical research to exist. However, there are many obstacles in the collaboration process. This paper reports on the experiences gained by the author, in a 2-year collaboration project on software testing which involved on-site work by the researcher in the industry premises. Based on notes, minutes of meetings, and progress reports, the project history is outlined. The project is analyzed, using collaboration models as a frame of reference. We conclude that there must be a balance between company 'pull' and academia 'push' in the collaboration Management support is inevitably a key factor to success, while other factors like cross-cultural skills and interfaces towards key resources also contribute.",1
Practical Experiences in Designing and Conducting Empirical Studies in Industry-Academia Collaboration,"More and more, software engineering researchers are motivated to solve real problems that bring value to industry. An example is the industry-academia collaboration described in this paper among everis, an IT consulting firm, and the GESSI research group at UPC. The goal of this paper is twofold: to evaluate the success of the collaboration, and to report the experience with conducting empirical studies in the industry and lessons learnt. We evaluated our collaboration with an existing model for technology transfer, and performed a focus group discussion to identify challenges we have faced. After initialization and alignment of the collaboration, a high maturity level has been achieved: we have obtained the first results in form of proposed solutions, scientific publications, and pilots run in real projects. In spite of this positive progress, further initiatives need to be undertaken in the last phases of the collaboration to achieve high degrees of maturity in deployment impact, industry benefit and innovativeness. Evaluating the collaboration has been positive, since we identified the next steps to be taken to achieve a high degree of technology transfer and innovation dissemination. We think it is a needed step in industry-academia collaborations in order to improve their success.",1
"Requirements engineering and technology transfer: obstacles, incentives and improvement agenda","For many years, research results in requirements engineering (RE) have been developed without much interaction with, or impact on, industrial practice. Why is it so difficult to introduce RE research results into mainstream RE practice? This paper attempts to provide answers to this question by describing obstacles that researchers and practitioners have encountered when they attempted technology transfer. In addition, major incentives for using RE methods are discussed, along with ideas for improving current RE practice. The paper summarises, clarifies and extends the results of two panel discussions, one at the Twelfth Conference on Advanced information Systems Engineering (CAiSE?00) and the other at the Fourth IEEE Conference on Requirements Engineering (ICRE?00).",1
Technology transfer: why some succeed and some don't,"In this paper we present several technology transfer cases both successes and failures. These cases describe transfers from research department within a large corporation to a product company, university to a large product company and university to a small product company. Based on the analysis of these cases we outline several strategies that can be used, in isolation or combined, in order to increase the probability for success.",1
Research Collaborations between Academia and Industry,"The rapid and complex research and innovation processes require high-tech companies to optimize their technology transfer processes. It is clearly not sufficient to solely rely on internal R&amp;D; strategic cooperations with external research centers of excellence are needed in order to compete in the global innovation market. Candidates for such strategic cooperations are universities, research institutions, and technology focused consulting companies. Key challenge is the effective integration of external competences into the company-internal innovation processes. In this paper we present a survey of the state-of-the-art in technology transfer, high-light promising success cases for the future, and derive success criteria for successful technology transfer in a global world. The cooperation between Siemens and Fraunhofer IESE is presented as a concrete example.",1
Collaborative Practice Research,"Reports from a systems development research tradition in which emphasis is put on relating research activities to practice and on establishing fruitful collaboration between groups of researchers and practitioners. Describes and evaluates a specific research project in which a large group of researchers and practitioners worked together to understand, support, and improve systems development practices in four organisations over a period of three years. Uses the case to reflect on the research goals, approaches, and results involved in this tradition for researching systems development practice. Proposes collaborative practice research as a way to organise and conduct research into systems development practice based on close collaboration between researchers and practitioners. Exemplifies the use of pluralist research methodology by combining action research with experiments and conventional practice studies. Argues that collaborative practice research offers one practical way to strike a useful balance between relevance and rigour. Concludes with a discussion of the implications for the relation between research and practice within the systems development discipline and with lessons on how to design research efforts as collaborations between researchers and practitioners.",1
Some researcher considerations when conducting empirical studies in industry,"Research collaborations must be set up for a win-win relationship, avoiding many hurdles along the way. In this short paper the goal is to identify some considerations when conducting empirical studies in industry. These considerations deal with problem solution approaches, communication focus, unpleasant results, mismatching interpretations and scope, business aspects and some evaluation criteria for a successful collaboration.",1
Strategies for industrial relevance in software engineering education,"This paper presents a collection of experiences related to success factors in graduate and postgraduate education. The experiences are mainly concerned with how to make the education relevant from an industrial viewpoint. This is emphasized as a key issue in software engineering education and research, as the main objective is to give the students a good basis for large-scale software development in an industrial environment. The presentation is divided into experiences at the graduate and postgraduate levels, respectively. For each level a number of strategies to achieve industrial relevance are presented. On the graduate level a course in large-scale software development is described to exemplify how industrial relevance can be achieved on the graduate level. The strategies on the postgraduate level have been successful, but it is concluded that more can be done regarding industrial collaboration in the planning and conduction of experiments and case studies. Another interesting strategy for the future is a special postgraduate program for people employed in industry.",1
Success factors for empirical studies in industry-academia collaboration: A reflection,"We conducted several empirical studies over the last couple of years as part of a collaboration with industrial partners in the area of software product lines. Our studies differed regarding their motivation and goals, their scope, the research methods applied, and the involved subjects. In this experience paper we briefly summarize the studies and their key characteristics. We reflect on our experiences based on the success factors for industry-academia collaborations by Wohlin et al. We discuss the role of empirical studies in long-term industry-academia collaborations and present lessons learned.",1
Lessons Learned from 25 Years of Process Improvement: The Rise and Fall of the NASA Software Engineering Laboratory,"For 25 years the NASA/GSFC Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) has been a major resource in software process improvement activities. But due to a changing climate at NASA, agency reorganization, and budget cuts, the SEL has lost much of its impact. In this paper we describe the history of the SEL and give some lessons learned on what we did right, what we did wrong, and what others can learn from our experiences. We briefly describe the research that was conducted by the SEL, describe how we evolved our understanding of software process improvement, and provide a set of lessons learned and hypotheses that should enable future groups to learn from and improve on our quarter century of experiences.",1
The 4+1 View Model of Industry--Academia Collaboration,"Industry--academia projects exist in complex contexts of various stakeholders, time perspectives, and goals. In order to analyze projects and communicate about them, we have defined an ""architectural"" model for industry--academia collaboration, inspired by Kruchten's software architecture model. The model has four views of i) time, ii) space, iii) activity and iv) domain, corresponding to the questions: when, where, how and what. The +1 view is the scenario, binding the other four together. We illustrate the model by applying it to the Industrial Excellence Center EASE and the Sigrun Software Innovation and Engineering Institute. The model helps analyzing industry--academia collaboration projects, to find gaps and reduce redundant work.",1
The Success Factors Powering Industry-Academia Collaboration,Collaboration between industry and academia supports improvement and innovation in industry and helps to ensure industrial relevance in academic research. This article presents an exploratory study of the factors for successful collaboration between industry and academia in software research.,1
Topic Selection in Industry Experiments,"This paper shares our experience with initial negotiation and topic elicitation process for conducting industry experiments in six software development organizations in Finland. The process involved interaction with company representatives in the form of both multiple group discussions and separate face-to-face meetings. Fitness criteria developed by researchers were applied to the list of generated topics to decide on a common topic. The challenges we faced include diversity of proposed topics, communication gaps, skepticism about research methods, initial disconnect between research and industry needs, and lack of prior work relationship. Lessons learned include having enough time to establish trust with partners, importance of leveraging the benefits of training and skill development that are inherent in the experimental approach, uniquely positioning the experimental approach within the landscape of other validation approaches more familiar to industrial partners, and introducing the fitness criteria early in the process.",1
Lessons Learned on Applying Design Science for Bridging the Collaboration Gap between Industry and Academia in Empirical Software Engineering,"Collaboration between industry practitioners and researchers has been reported as a challenge to conduct empirical studies in software engineering. Gaining practitioners interest in research activities is challenging in the software development industry characterized by tough competition and short time-to-market. Often, practitioners do not see the direct value in collaborating with researchers. Meanwhile, researchers are frequently frustrated because they have no access to the real-world data that would enable them to develop scientific knowledge. Design science has become a popular research framework in Information Systems. This paper describes our lessons learned on how design science can help to attract and motivate industry practitioners to take part in empirical research. We present our practical experiences with using design science in the context of empirical software engineering, and how the design science framework helped us to bridge the collaborative gap with our industry partners. In illustrating our experiences, we present two case studies conducted in collaboration with Ericsson and Elektrobit in which the design science framework was followed. Based on our experience, design science is a suitable research framework for empirical software engineering since much of the research in the field is constructive. The similarities between the design science practices and the day-to-day work of practitioners in industry make it easy for them to understand the research approach. Thus, it supports their willingness to participate in research activities.",1
Embedding Research in the Industrial Field: A Case of a Transition to a Software Product Line,"Java Cards [4, 5] are small resource-constrained embedded systems that have to fulfill rigorous security requirements. Multiple application scenarios demand diverse product performance profiles which are targeted towards markets such as banking applications and mobile applications. In order to tailor the products to the customer's needs we implemented a Software Product Line (SPL). This paper reports on the industrial case of an adoption to a SPL during the development of a highly-secure software system. In order to provide a scientific method which allows the description of research in the field, we apply Action Research (AR). The rationale of AR is to foster the transition of knowledge from a mature research field to practical problems encountered in the daily routine. Thus, AR is capable of providing insights which might be overlooked in a traditional research approach. In this paper we follow the iterative AR process, and report on the successful transfer of knowledge from a research project to a real industrial application.",1
Industry Academia Collaboration: An Experience Report at a Small University,This paper is a report on how sustainable and fruitful cooperation was achieved between a small university department and an industry partner. It outlines the range and type of activities that need tube undertaken over a longer than normal duration. It also describes the expectations from the industry partner for the cooperation to be successful.,1
Research-based innovation: A tale of three projects in model-driven engineering,"Inrecentyears,wehavebeenexploringwaystofosteracloser collaboration between software engineering research and industry both to align our research with practical needs, and to increase awareness about the importance of research for innovation. This paper outlines our expe- rience with three research projects conducted in collaboration with the industry. We examine the way we collaborated with our industry part- ners and describe the decisions that contributed to the effectiveness of the collaborations. We report on the lessons learned from our experience and illustrate the lessons using examples from the three projects. The lessons focus on the applications of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), as all the three projects we draw on here were MDE projects. Our goal from structuring and sharing our experience is to contribute to a better understanding of how researchers and practitioners can collaborate more effectively and to gain more value from their collaborations.",1
Bridging the Gap: SE Technology Transfer into Practice: Study Design and Preliminary Results,"Background: Particularly during and after research projects, technology transfer into practice plays an important role for academia to get technologies into use and for industry to improve their development. Objective: Our goal was to gain more and current knowledge about how technology transfer from software engineering (SE) research into industrial practice is accomplished best and how to measure the effectiveness of this transfer. Method: We conducted a study in the context of two German research projects, covering many different organizations from industry and academia. Results: This paper presents the design of the study and the survey performed. After introducing the concept of technology transfer we used and adapted, we present preliminary results. Conclusions: We observed that traditional means such as meetings or workshops are still the most widely used mediums for technology transfer in SE. We also discovered that, even though the duration of transfer depends on the object being transferred, the average duration is three years, which is far less than previously published (~18 years).",1
Requirements Engineering Process Improvement: A Knowledge Transfer Experience,"In the last decade, research in requirements engineering has achieved great advances. Several methods, techniques and processes have been proposed in the literature. However, the pace of requirements engineering technology transfer has been slow. This paper presents a technology transfer project to improve the requirements engineering process in four software companies. We discuss this experience from the perspective of researchers and practitioners from one participating company.",1
A Modeling Language's Evolution Driven by Tight Interaction between Academia and Industry,"Domain specific languages play an important role in model-driven engineering of software-intensive industrial systems. A rich body of knowledge exists on the development of languages, modeling environments, and transformation systems. The understanding of architectural choices for combining these parts into a feasible solution, however, is not particularly deep. We report on an endeavor in the realm of a technology transfer process from academia to industry, where we encountered unexpected influences of the architecture on the modeling language. By examining the evolution of our language and its programming interface, we show that these influences mainly stemmed from practical considerations; for identifying these early on, tight interaction between our research lab and the industrial partner was key. In addition, we share insights into the practice of cooperating with industry by presenting essential lessons we learned.",1
Co-Evolutionary Service-Oriented Model of Technology Transfer in Software Engineering,"This article proposes a co-evolutionary service-oriented model, an organizational architecture for accelerating technology transfer between co-evolving organizations. Conventional model of technology transfer implies a unidirectional transfer from technology providers to technology requesters. However, this is not a case in successful technology transfer. In our experience, we observed a reciprocal feedback relationship between the providers and requesters. As the model of such collaboration, we propose a co-evolutionary model of technology transfer, which enables to adjust the level of maturity of technology to be transferred and accelerate the transfer process.",1
The Management of University--Industry Collaborations Involving Empirical Studies of Software Enginee,"In this chapter we will discuss some of the pragmatic considerations that we believe university researchers and companies should consider when establishing collaborative software engineering research projects; in particular, those involving empirical studies of software engineers. The chapter is illustrated using as a case study a research collaboration in which the authors are involved. We enumerate the costs, benefits, risks and risk-reducing factors that can have an impact on all the parties involved in the collaboration (the company, the faculty members and the graduate student researchers). Understanding this information is needed to help justify the research in the first place, and to manage it effectively. We then discuss many of the activities that will be needed to plan and manage the project, including such issues as attracting students, handling intellectual property, obtaining ethical approval and interacting with participants. The main objective of the chapter is to provoke some thoughts in the minds of those planning empirical research projects in software engineering.",1
External Experiments--A Workable Paradigm for Collaboration Between Industry and Academia,"Results of empirical investigations are key input for industrial software process improvement activities. The relevance of an investigation for a given environment, however, depends on the similarities or dissimilarities of the investigation environment compared to the industrial environment which is interested in using a new technology. The optimal (or most relevant) results may be gained when performing the experiment in the industrial environment itself. Unfortunately, this takes place only rarely as experiments in industrial environments are either expensive (when new and old technology are used in parallel) or risky (when only the new technology is used). To overcome this dilemma, we introduced the concept of external experiments, i.e. experiments which are conducted in an environment different from the industrial target environment and which tries to simulate the characteristics of the industrial environment as best as possible. This paper describes this concept in detail, presents a process for identification, conduction and exploitation of such experiments and shows some results from past investigations which used this concept",1
Requirements engineering technology transfer: an experience report,"This paper is an experience report on an initiative to incorporate requirements engineering practices into the development process of two large corporations. The project was framed by a government program to foster collaboration between academia, industry, and government agencies. Its expected result?proposals for cooperative work?is in itself a major challenge, since it was not decided from the beginning what aspect of requirements engineering would be covered by the proposals.We describe the cooperation process followed by the project partners, three universities, and two companies, the difficulties found therein, and compare our experience with other reports on the issue of adoption of requirements engineering into the mainstream practice.",1
Understanding and improving technology transfer in software engineering,"Technology transfer in software engineering involves more than a new idea or evidence that it works. This paper illustrates how technology transfer requires a good idea, the generation of evidence, analysis of that evidence, good packaging and support, and careful consideration of the audience for the technology. By learning from other disciplines, we present a model of technology transfer that can be tailored to a particular organisation's needs.",1
