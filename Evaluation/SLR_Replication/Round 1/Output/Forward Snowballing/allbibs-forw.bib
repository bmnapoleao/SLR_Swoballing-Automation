 abstract = {The establishment of collaborative AI pipelines, in which multiple organizations share their data and models, is often complicated by lengthy data governance processes and legal clarifications. Data sovereignty solutions, which ensure data is being used under agreed terms and conditions, are promising to overcome these problems. However, there is limited research on their applicability in AI pipelines. In this study, we extended an existing AI pipeline at Mondragon Corporation, in which sensor data is collected and subsequently forwarded to a data quality service provider with a data sovereignty component. By systematically reflecting and generalizing our experiences during the twelve-month action research project, we formulated ten lessons learned, four benefits, and three barriers to data-sovereign AI pipelines that can inform further research and custom implementations. Our results show that a data sovereignty component can help reduce existing barriers and increase the success of collaborative data science initiatives. CCS CONCEPTS • Security and privacy → Privacy protections; • Software and its engineering → Data flow architectures.},

 abstract = {Context: Agile software development has become commonplace in software development companies due to the numerous benefits it provides. However, conducting Agile projects is demanding in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), because projects start and end quickly, but still have to fulfil customers’ quality requirements. Objective: This paper aims at reporting a practical experience on the use of metrics related to the software development process as a means supporting SMEs in the development of software following an Agile methodology. Method: We followed Action-Research principles in a Polish small-size software development company. We developed and executed a study protocol suited to the needs of the company, using a pilot case. Results: A catalogue of Agile development process metrics practically validated in the context of a small-size software development company, adopted by the company in their Agile projects. Conclusions: Practitioners may adopt these metrics in their Agile projects, especially if working in an SME, and customise them to their own needs and tools. Academics may use the findings as a baseline for new research work, including new empirical studies.},

@article{Condori_Fernandez_2020,
 abstract = {In the last years, software engineering researchers have defined sustainability as a quality requirement of software, but not enough effort has been devoted to develop new methods/techniques to support the analysis and assessment of software sustainability. In this study, we present the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) that consists of two instruments: the software sustainability–quality model, and the architectural decision map. Then, we use participatory and technical action research in close collaboration with the software industry to validate the SAF regarding its applicability in specific cases. The unit of analysis of our study is a family of software products (Geographic Information System- and Mobile-based Workforce Management Systems) that aim to address sustainability goals (e.g., efficient collection of dead animals to mitigate social and environmental sustainability risks). The results show that the sustainability–quality model integrated with the architectural decision maps can be used to identify sustainability–quality requirements as design concerns because most of its quality attributes (QAs) have been either addressed in the software project or acknowledged as relevant (i.e., creating awareness on the relevance of the multidimensional sustainability nature of certain QAs). Moreover, the action–research method has been helpful to enrich the sustainability–quality model, by identifying missing QAs (e.g., regulation compliance, data privacy). Finally, the architectural decision maps have been found as useful to guide software architects/designers in their decision-making process.},

@article{Deckers_2022,
 abstract = {To enable the people involved in a software development process to communicate and reason close to their area of knowledge, we are investigating a method to formalize and integrate knowledge of multiple domains into domain models and into specifications in terms of those domain models. For this purpose, we have previously defined a set of method objectives, and an initial version of the method –called MuDForM. This paper reports on the methodical support for using a domain model as terminology to define other specifications, and feature specifications in particular. We performed a case study to validate how well the method helps in the specification of processes and to realize the case-specific objectives of the customer. The case study pertains to the formalization of the ISO26262 standard for functional safety in the automotive domain. We found that our method is suitable to systematically formalize a process that is described in natural language, such that there is a clear separation of domain-specific concepts, unambiguous process specifications, and concepts from outside the domain and process of interest. We have extended our method with concepts, steps, and guidelines for grammatical analysis, for the formalization of constraints, and for the specification of processes. The case-specific results are the unambiguous specification of a part of the ISO26262 processes.},

 abstract = {Context: Software testing is an important and costly software engineering activity in the industry. Despite the efforts of the software testing research community in the last several decades, various studies show that still many practitioners in the industry report challenges in their software testing tasks.

Objective: To shed light on industry’s challenges in software testing, we characterize and synthesize the challenges reported by practitioners. Such concrete challenges can then be used for a variety of purposes, e.g., research collaborations between industry and academia. 

Method: Our empirical research method is opinion survey. By designing an online survey, we solicited practitioners’ opinions about their challenges in different testing activities. Our dataset includes data from 72 practitioners from eight different countries. 

Results: Our results show test management and test automation are considered the most challenging among all testing activities by practitioners. Our results also include a set of 104 concrete challenges in software testing that may need further investigations by the research community.

Conclusion: We conclude that the focal points of industrial work and academic research in software testing differ. Furthermore, the paper at hand provides valuable insights concerning practitioners’ “pain” points and, thus, provides researchers with a source of important research topics of high practical relevance.},

 abstract = {In the context of a software testing company, we have deployed the model-based testing (MBT) approach to take the company’s test automation practices to higher levels of maturity and capability. We have chosen, from a set of open-source/commercial MBT tools, an open-source tool named GraphWalker, and have pragmatically used MBT for end-to-end test automation of several large web and mobile applications under test. The MBT approach has provided, so far in our project, various tangible and intangible benefits in terms of improved test coverage (number of paths tested), improved test-design practices, and also improved real-fault detection effectiveness. The goal of this experience report (applied research report), done based on “action research”, is to share our experience of applying and evaluating MBT as a software technology (technique and tool) in a real industrial setting. We aim at contributing to the body of empirical evidence in industrial application of MBT by sharing our industry-academia project on applying MBT in practice, the insights that we have gained, and the challenges and questions that we have faced and tackled so far. We discuss an overview of the industrial setting, provide motivation, explain the events leading to the outcomes, discuss the challenges faced, summarize the outcomes, and conclude with lessons learned, take-away messages, and practical advices based on the described experience. By learning from the best practices in this paper, other test engineers could conduct more mature MBT in their test projects.},

 abstract = {The architecting of Systems of Systems (SoS), that is, of systems that emerge from the cooperation of multiple independent constituent systems, is a topic of increasing interest in both industry and academia. However, recent empirical studies revealed what seems to be an overlooked aspect of the architecting of SoS that is linked to major integration and operational issues: the interplay between the various disciplines involved in such an architecting process. This aspect becomes particularly relevant for the management of the interfaces between the SoS constituents, where such disciplines inevitably meet. In this paper, we present the results of the first cycle of a Technical Action Research (TAR) study conducted in cooperation between the authors and a group of practitioners involved in the long-running architecting process of a large-scale radio astronomy SoS project. This TAR is aimed at exploring potential improvements of the document-centered interface management approach currently followed in this project by adopting elements of the documentation-as-code philosophy, which is widely adopted in the domain of software systems. As a result, a working proof-of-concept of an ICD (Interface Control Document) management approach was developed by the researchers and evaluated by the practitioners. The results of the study and the corresponding lessons learned are reported in this work.

 abstract = {This document describes our experience of applying data analytics at Plexina, a leading IT company working in the healthcare domain. The main goal of the project was to identify factors currently affecting issue management and to make analytics based suggestions for optimizing the process. Various statistical and machine learning techniques were applied on a data set extracted from six releases of Plexina, containing more than 666 issues. Statistical techniques successfully identified the various factors that leads to estimation inaccuracy related to issues as well as identified the hidden relationships existing among various variables. The employed predictive analytic models was also successful to some extent, in predicting effort estimation related inaccuracy associated with the issues. The insights provided by the entire data analytics study can be of great help to product managers or the developers to make more informed decisions. In addition, the guidelines presented in this paper based on the lessons learnt can be applied to other data analytics and academia-industry collaboration project.},

Krisen erfordern flexibles Handeln und schnelle Anpassungen sowohl von Menschen als auch von öffentlichen Institutionen. Die öffentliche Hand und insbesondere die deutschen Gesundheitsbehörden sind während der Covid-19-Pandemie, beginnend im März 2020, massiv herausgefordert. Die Bewältigung des teilweise exponentiell wachsenden Prozessvolumens durch kurzfristige Infektionsereignisse muss in kürzester Zeit fachgerecht erfolgen und unterliegt einer permanenten Reaktion und Anpassung an sich ändernde Rahmenbedingungen. Bestehende Strukturen und ineffiziente Prozesse erschweren diese notwendige Skalierung der Bearbeitung zunehmend. In diesem Beitrag werden mittels Aktionsforschung Ansätze für eine beschleunigte und flexible Entwicklung von Robotic Process Automation (RPA)-Lösungen zur Automatisierung bestehender Verwaltungsprozesse innerhalb einer betroffenen Gesundheitsbehörde in Deutschland untersucht. Als Ergebnis wurden Ansätze für eine schnellere und weniger komplexe Entwicklung von RPA-Lösungen in einer sehr schnell skalierenden und gleichzeitig stark heterogenen IT-Systemlandschaft erarbeitet und bewertet.},

 abstract = {Adoption of structured reuse approaches in practice often poses multiple challenges. Research-industry collaborations are considered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties as well as to validate the applicability of scientific results. However, research cooperations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners in the context of a study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the participating companies had undertaken two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse. However, both attempts did not succeed as expected. In our study, we identified tacit assumptions that were related to the encountered difficulties and present the lessons learned from the adoption approach. Furthermore , we report strategies that helped us to overcome the skepticism caused by a previous unsuccessful guided collaboration.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application.

Objective
This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering.

Method
We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis.

Results
Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer.

Conclusion
Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.},

In this work, an empirical study was carried out to understand how the measurement process aligned with quality models can be implemented in these organizations. The field study followed the implementation of an improvement program based on CMMI® level 2 in 7 Brazilian companies from Maringá, Paraná. Finally, it was found that the process for the definition of a measurement guide can be common to a specific group of companies, taking steps and guidelines for its execution, always aligned with the organization’s strategy, giving top management an objective view work and process, supporting decision making.},

Therefore, this study aimed on investigating the suitability of the combination of Agile Methodologies and the DSR in developing information systems for Tanzania's HEIs. The study used eXtreme Programming as one of the Agile Methodologies and the DSR to develop a timetabling software which easily integrates into the existing academic information system of the College of Business Education for better decision making. Likewise, the evaluation of the developed artifact confirmed that the resulting product raised the user satisfaction with the information system in HEIs.

Specifically, considering software development, knowledge capitalisation demands an analysis that considers four complementary and interdependent perspectives on knowledge: value, security, utility and status. These perspectives focus on different facets according to which knowledge can be analysed, in addition to provide a foundation for a better awareness on knowledge and the necessary treatment. This study presents an empirical study with the purpose of evaluating the relevance of these perspectives by using a survey questionnaire distributed to software development companies in the Brazilian market. Three hundred thirty nine individuals from different 339 companies were subjects of such a study. The results indicate that the perspectives are relevant for evaluating knowledge and reinforcing the relevance of exploring knowledge capitalisation in software development; therefore, there is a clear understanding of how the knowledge assets involved can be analysed or assessed.},

Although design processes of industry engineers have been examined in multiple research studies, few studies have investigated design processes of academic engineers. As academia and industry have different sociocultural norms and constraints, their design processes likely also differ. To examine this question, we conducted semi-structured interviews with both academic and industry engineers who had successfully designed medical devices. Our qualitative findings revealed that engineers in industry described their design process as a sequence with problem definition, solution exploration, detail design, evaluation, and communication. Academic engineers, in contrast, described their design process as beginning with a discovered solution, then searching for application problems, evaluating compatibility between problems and solution, and finally, communicating their findings through publications. Understanding differences in design processes of academic and industry engineers can facilitate knowledge sharing and promote collaboration between academia and industry. The findings also highlight the impact of sociocultural norms on practices, even in disciplines with highly trained and clearly defined processes.},

 abstract = {Software reference architectures are becoming widely adopted by organizations that need to support the design and maintenance of software applications of a shared domain. For organizations that plan to adopt this architecture-centric approach, it becomes fundamental to know the return on investment and to understand how software reference architectures are designed, maintained, and used. Unfortunately, there is little evidence-based support to help organizations with these challenges.
We have conducted action research in an industry-academia collaboration between the GESSI research group and everis, a multinational IT consulting firm based in Spain.
The results from such collaboration are being packaged in order to create guidelines that could be used in similar contexts as the one of everis. The main result of this paper is the construction of empirically-grounded guidelines that support organizations to decide on the adoption of software reference architectures and to gather evidence to improve RA-related practices.
The created guidelines could be used by other organizations outside of our industry-academia collaboration. With this goal in mind, we describe the guidelines in detail for their use.},

SERP-test can be utilized for direct communication in industry academia collaborations. It may also facilitate indirect communication between practitioners adopting software engineering research and researchers who are striving for industry relevance. SERP-test was constructed through a systematic and goal-oriented approach which included literature reviews and interviews with practitioners and researchers. SERP-test was evaluated through an online survey and by utilizing it in an industry–academia collaboration project. SERP-test comprises four facets along which both research contributions and practical challenges may be classified: Intervention, Scope, Effect target and Context constraints. This paper explains the available categories for each of these facets (i.e., their definitions and rationales) and presents examples of categorized entities. Several tasks may benefit from SERP-test, such as formulating research goals from a problem perspective, describing practical challenges in a researchable fashion, analyzing primary studies in a literature review, or identifying relevant points of comparison and generalization of research.},

Using the participant observation and interview methods, we have collected and afterwards analyzed an extensive record of qualitative data. Drawing upon the findings made and the experience gained, we provide a set of 14 patterns and 14 anti-patterns for industry–academia collaborations, aimed to support other researchers and practitioners in establishing and running research collaboration projects in software engineering.},

This article reports on the experience of research collaboration and knowledge co-creation between industry and academia in software engineering as a way to bridge the research–practice collaboration gap. Our experience spans 14 years of collaboration between researchers in software engineering and the European and Norwegian software and IT industry. Using the participant observation and interview methods, we have collected and afterwards analyzed an extensive record of qualitative data. Drawing upon the findings made and the experience gained, we provide a set of 14 patterns and 14 anti-patterns for industry–academia collaborations, aimed to support other researchers and practitioners in establishing and running research collaboration projects in software engineering.},

@article{Menon_2021,
 abstract = {Purpose
The study has a two-fold purpose: first, to identify the enablers of partnering agility in higher education, and, second, to analyze the interplay between the enablers.

Design/methodology/approach
Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) was used to construct a theoretical model of partnering agility enablers, and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank and segregate the enablers into independent, autonomous, dependent and linkage zones on the basis of their driving and dependence power.

Findings
The study helped in identifying eight enablers that can be instrumental in driving partnering agility in higher education. According to the TISM model, clarity on roles and responsibilities of partners was found to be the most crucial and vital enabler followed by resource sharing.

Practical implications
The conceptual model provides a new direction on how to develop and strengthen higher education partnerships. The model has prioritized all the crucial enablers that the management can work around in order to drive partnering agility in higher education institutions.

Originality/value
Studies in the past have majorly focused on academia–industry partnerships. This research has tried to provide a comprehensive view of the enablers and the multidirectional interplay between the enablers that can facilitate partnerships between academia and industry, Indian and international universities, and academia and community.},

Furthermore, we believe that a collaboration between University and Industry is must or important in achieving the stated goals and agenda of MSR research (such as deployment and technology transfer). We analyse past five years of research papers published in MSR series of conferences (2010-2014) and count the number of studies using solely OSS data or solely CSS data or both OSS and CSS data. We also count the number of papers published by authors solely from Universities, solely from Industry and from both University and Industry. We present our findings which indicate lack of University-Industry collaboration (measured using co-authorship in scientific publications) and paucity of empirical studies on CSS/PSS data. Our analysis reveals that out of 187 studies over a period of 5 years, 90:9% studies are conducted solely on OSS dataset. We present our findings which indicate that only 14:43% of the studies involve a University-Industry collaboration.},

 abstract = {Background: In large-scale corporations in the software engineering context information overload problems occur as stakeholders continuously produce useful information on process life-cycle issues, matters related to specific products under development, etc. Information overload makes finding relevant information (e.g., how did the company apply the requirements process for product X?) challenging, which is in the primary focus of this paper. Contribution: In this study the authors aimed at evaluating the ease of implementing a semantic knowledge management system at Ericsson, including the essential components of such systems (such as text processing, ontologies, semantic annotation and semantic search). Thereafter, feedback on the usefulness of the system was collected from practitioners. Method: A single case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB in Sweden. Results: It was found that semantic knowledge management systems are challenging to implement, this refers in particular to the implementation and integration of ontologies. Specific ontologies for structuring and filtering are essential, such as domain ontologies and ontologies distinct to the organization. Conclusion: To be readily adopted and transferable to practice, desired ontologies need to be implemented and integrated into semantic knowledge management frameworks with ease, given that the desired ontologies are dependent on organizations and domains.},

We will elaborate on the challenges, essential practices, and related benefits that were observed when working closely with industry in the role of embedded researchers. Supporting examples from different published cases form the basis for this experience report.},

 abstract = {Regression testing is a means to assure that a change in the software, or its execution environment, does not introduce new defects. It involves the expensive undertaking of rerunning test cases. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of test cases to execute in regression testing, however, there is no research on how to assess industrial relevance and applicability of such techniques. We conducted a systematic literature review with the following two goals: firstly, to enable researchers to design and present regression testing research with a focus on industrial relevance and applicability and secondly, to facilitate the industrial adoption of such research by addressing the attributes of concern from the practitioners’ perspective. Using a reference-based search approach, we identified 1068 papers on regression testing. We then reduced the scope to only include papers with explicit discussions about relevance and applicability (i.e. mainly studies involving industrial stakeholders). Uniquely in this literature review, practitioners were consulted at several steps to increase the likelihood of achieving our aim of identifying factors important for relevance and applicability. We have summarised the results of these consultations and an analysis of the literature in three taxonomies, which capture aspects of industrial-relevance regarding the regression testing techniques. Based on these taxonomies, we mapped 38 papers reporting the evaluation of 26 regression testing techniques in industrial settings.},

Given this scenario, industry is forced to search for new partners, with the university- industry collaboration representing a fundamental resource in promoting innovation and technological development. This study aims to obtain and analyse the perceptions and experiences of representatives of this industry and the university, in order to identify a set of factors that could enhance and/or be the source of a sustainable collaboration, based on knowledge management. In nutshell, the results show that motivations are associated with the immediate opportunities or needs of each of those directly involved in the collaboration take priority, without building a sustainable collaboration.

SERP-test can be utilized for direct communication in industry academia collaborations. It may also facilitate indirect communication between practitioners adopting software engineering research and researchers who are striving for industry relevance. SERP-test was constructed through a systematic and goal-oriented approach which included literature reviews and interviews with practitioners and researchers. SERP-test was evaluated through an online survey and by utilizing it in an industry–academia collaboration project. SERP-test comprises four facets along which both research contributions and practical challenges may be classified: Intervention, Scope, Effect target and Context constraints. This paper explains the available categories for each of these facets (i.e., their definitions and rationales) and presents examples of categorized entities. Several tasks may benefit from SERP-test, such as formulating research goals from a problem perspective, describing practical challenges in a researchable fashion, analyzing primary studies in a literature review, or identifying relevant points of comparison and generalization of research.},

@article{Farooq_2019,
 abstract = {Doing the right kind of testing has always been one of main challenging and a decisive task for industry. To choose right software testing method(s), industry needs to have an exact objective knowledge of their effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability conditions. The most common way to evaluate testing methods, for such knowledge, is with empirical studies. Reliable and comprehensive evidence can be obtained by aggregating the results of different empirical studies (family of experiments) taking into account their findings and limitations. We conducted a study to investigate the current state of the art of empirical knowledge base of three testing methods. We found that although the empirical studies conducted so far to evaluate testing methods contain many important and interesting results; however, we still lack factual and generalizable knowledge about performance and applicability conditions of testing methods(s), making it unfeasible to be readily adopted by the industry. Moreover, we tried to identify the major factors responsible for limiting academia from producing significantly reliable results having an industrial impact. We believe that besides effective and long-term academia-industry collaboration, there is a need for more systematic, quantifiable and comprehensive empirical studies (which provides scope for aggregation using rigorous techniques), mainly replications so as to create an effective and applicable knowledge base about testing methods which potentially can fill the gap between academia and industry.},

Unlike regular software, integrated software products require detailed exploration on the spread and impact of a defect to improve overall product quality. In this paper, we use heuristic approaches like generalized defect dependency approach, control flow graph based approach, and feature correlation based approach to study the widespread of defects in large software and suggest a metric called defect dependency metric to study the dependency of defects. We implemented the generalized defect dependency approach on an industry dataset and gathered noteworthy results. We provide a comparative a study of the heuristic approaches and comprehended their individual usage with observations. We further discuss the need of adoption of such vision in industries as a standard testing practice to improve quality.},

This is the start of the most nerve-wrecking moments of a product's release cycle, i.e., should one run the risk of not doing anything and users losing precious data, or of prematurely engaging the tedious (and costly) roll-back procedure towards the previous release? Thus far, only little attention has been paid by researchers to these so-called " botched releases " , partly because of lack of release log data. This paper studies 345 releases of a large e-commerce web app over a period of 1.5 years, in which we identified 17 recurrent root causes of botched releases, classified into four major categories. We then build explanatory models to understand which root causes are the most important, and to explore the factors leading to botched releases.},

 abstract = {It has become inevitable for every software developer to understand, to follow that how and why software fails, and to express reliability in quantitative terms. This has led to a proliferation of software reliability models to estimate and predict reliability. The basic approach is to model past failure data to predict future behavior. Most of the models have three major components: assumptions, factors and a mathematical function, usually high order exponential or logarithmic used to relate factors to reliability. Software reliability models are used to forecast the curve of failure rate by statistical evidence available during testing phase. They also can indicate about the extra time required to carry out the test procedure in order to meet the specifications and deliver desired functionality with minimum number of defects. Therefore there are challenges whether, autonomous or machine learning techniques like other predictive methods could be able to forecast the reliability measures for a specific software application. This chapter contemplates reliability issue through a generic Machine Learning paradigm while referring the most common aspects of Support Vector Machine scenario. Couples of customized simulation and experimental results have been presented to support the proposed reliability measures and strategies.},

This study confirms a number of methodological challenges already identified in the software engineering literature. Based on recommendations from the literature and our own experience, we propose a process for future observational exploratory studies.},

@article{Malhotra_2022,
 abstract = {Industry-academia collaboration (IAC) has long been a source of discussion in various ways. A vital first step toward closing the gap is fostering alumni engagement in industry and academia. Industry-academia collaborations are like earth and water, and they live in harmony. They cannot exist apart from one another. The collaborative effort between industry and academia promotes improvement and innovation in technology and innovative research and enables the university to be more relevant to the industry. This article proposes a collaborative approach based on alumni influences and uses secondary data on the influences of alumni in engineering to enrich the collaboration between industry and academia. The industry and academia utilize the alumni’s potential to facilitate communication and offer their students and staff facilities. The research findings can be used by policymakers to innovate in the field of engineering and to strengthen the partnership between industry and academia in society. The model enables academia and industry to utilize the alumni strengths in enriching the collaboration; it also enhances academic research output, recruitment, fundraising, marketing, product promotion, and internship opportunities for students via alumni active participation. We propose some significant agendas for future work.},

The process involved interaction with company representatives in the form of both multiple group discussions and separate face-to-face meetings. Fitness criteria developed by researchers were applied to the list of generated topics to decide on a common topic. The challenges we faced include diversity of proposed topics, communication gaps, skepticism about research methods, initial disconnect between research and industry needs, and lack of prior work relationship. Lessons learned include having enough time to establish trust with partners, importance of leveraging the benefits of training and skill development that are inherent in the experimental approach, uniquely positioning the experimental approach within the landscape of other validation approaches more familiar to industrial partners, and introducing the fitness criteria early in the process.},

The framework is versatile and can be run on a variety of target systems including programmable logic controllers and distributed control system implementations. However, the main attractive property of the framework stems from the goal of achieving smooth technology transfer from the academic setting to real industrial applications. Technology transfer is, in general, difficult to achieve, because of the apparent disconnect between academic studies and actual industry. The proposed software framework aims at bridging this gap for model predictive control—a powerful control technique which can result in substantial performance improvement of industrial control loops, thus adhering to modern trends for reducing energy waste and fulfilling sustainable development goals. In the paper, the proposed solution is motivated and described, and experimental evidence of its successful deployment is provided using a real industrial plant.},

There are many potential reasons for this, such as, problems in identifying helpful approaches, missing tools, or lacking practical relevance. With our current research, we are concerned to improve the knowledge transfer from research to practice. In this paper, we discuss the impact of development environments and programming languages on knowledge transfer - considering that many scientific approaches and tools are interesting for professional developers, but rarely adopted by them. We base our discussion mainly on our personal experiences with industry-academia collaborations. To determine whether these experiences also apply to other developers, we additionally conducted a survey with 89 participants from academia and industry. The first results of our on-going work indicate a gap between the development environments and programming languages that are supported or used by researchers and those that are applied in industry. Based on our results, we describe initial discussions that can help to improve collaborations between industry and research.},

While the overall perceived complexity of a product grows rather insignificantly, the small units, such as functions and files, can have noticeable complexity growth with every increment of product features. This kind of evolution triggers risks of escalating fault-proneness and deteriorating maintainability. The goal of this research was to develop a measurement system which enables effective monitoring of complexity evolution. An action research has been conducted in two large software development organizations. We have measured three complexity and two change properties of code for two large industrial products. The complexity growth has been measured for five consecutive releases of the products. Different patterns of growth have been identified and evaluated with software engineers in industry. The results show that monitoring cyclomatic complexity evolution of functions and number of revisions of files focuses the attention of designers to potentially problematic files and functions for manual assessment and improvement.

In this dynamic environment the continuous modifications of software code can cause risks for software developers; when developing a new feature increment, the added or modified code may contain fault-prone or difficult-to-maintain elements. The outcome of these risks can be defective software or decreased development velocity. This study presents a method to identify the risky areas and assess the risk when developing software code in Lean/Agile environment. We have conducted an action research project in two large companies, Ericsson AB and Volvo Group Truck Technology. During the study we have measured a set of code properties and investigated their influence on risk. The results show that the superposition of two metrics, complexity and revisions of a source code file, can effectively enable identification and assessment of the risk. We also illustrate how this kind of assessment can be successfully used by software developers to manage risks on a weekly basis as well as release-wise. A measurement system for systematic risk assessment has been introduced to two companies.},

 abstract = {Adoption of structured reuse approaches in practice often poses multiple challenges. Research-industry collaborations are considered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties as well as to validate the applicability of scientific results. However, research cooperations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners in the context of a study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the participating companies had undertaken two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse. However, both attempts did not succeed as expected. In our study, we identified tacit assumptions that were related to the encountered difficulties and present the lessons learned from the adoption approach. Furthermore , we report strategies that helped us to overcome the skepticism caused by a previous unsuccessful guided collaboration.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the construction and evaluation of SERP-test, a taxonomy aimed to improve communication between researchers and practitioners in the area of software testing. SERP-test can be utilized for direct communication in industry academia collaborations. It may also facilitate indirect communication between practitioners adopting software engineering research and researchers who are striving for industry relevance. SERP-test was constructed through a systematic and goal-oriented approach which included literature reviews and interviews with practitioners and researchers. SERP-test was evaluated through an online survey and by utilizing it in an industry–academia collaboration project. SERP-test comprises four facets along which both research contributions and practical challenges may be classified: Intervention, Scope, Effect target and Context constraints. This paper explains the available categories for each of these facets (i.e., their definitions and rationales) and presents examples of categorized entities. Several tasks may benefit from SERP-test, such as formulating research goals from a problem perspective, describing practical challenges in a researchable fashion, analyzing primary studies in a literature review, or identifying relevant points of comparison and generalization of research.},

 abstract = {To achieve software quality it is critical to quickly understand the current test status, its changes over time as well as its relation to source code changes. However, even if this information is available in test logs and code repositories it is seldomly put to good use in supporting decision processes in software development. The amount of information is often large, is time consuming to extract and hard to monitor. This case study shows how visualisation and correlation between software measurements can support improvement discussions. In particular, simple heat maps were found to be effective to visualize and monitor changes and identify recurring patterns in the development of a space-bourn, embedded control system. Statistical analysis quantified the correlation between different sources of development data and heat maps then effectively focused the attention of stakeholders to importants parts of the system. Here the visual analysis was focused on post-project, historical data but we discuss how early identification based on dynamic data analysis could support more effective analysis, planning and execution of quality assurance. Based on our findings we state requirements on such an online, visual analysis system and present a prototype implementation that can help software measurements better support value-based decisions in software development.},

 abstract = {Context: Software testing is an important and costly software engineering activity in the industry. Despite the efforts of the software testing research community in the last several decades, various studies show that still many practitioners in the industry report challenges in their software testing tasks.

Objective: To shed light on industry’s challenges in software testing, we characterize and synthesize the challenges reported by practitioners. Such concrete challenges can then be used for a variety of purposes, e.g., research collaborations between industry and academia. 

Method: Our empirical research method is opinion survey. By designing an online survey, we solicited practitioners’ opinions about their challenges in different testing activities. Our dataset includes data from 72 practitioners from eight different countries. 

Results: Our results show test management and test automation are considered the most challenging among all testing activities by practitioners. Our results also include a set of 104 concrete challenges in software testing that may need further investigations by the research community.

Conclusion: We conclude that the focal points of industrial work and academic research in software testing differ. Furthermore, the paper at hand provides valuable insights concerning practitioners’ “pain” points and, thus, provides researchers with a source of important research topics of high practical relevance.},

We facilitate and investigate five large RIC from the food and high-tech industry in Norway and Germany using an explorative qualitative action research design. Our research shows that the challenges of using DT in RIC are to some extent comparable to those for the corporate context. Additionally, we identify distinct challenges for RIC. Benefits from using DT in RIC are stronger user and innovation focus, better transdisciplinary collaboration, and triangulation of qualitative with scientific data. We suggest that complex RIC benefit from an intermediary (DT) role translating business needs into research questions, and research results into understandable and business-relevant information and innovation.},

The main goal of the project was to identify factors currently affecting issue management and to make analytics based suggestions for optimizing the process. Various statistical and machine learning techniques were applied on a data set extracted from six releases of Plexina, containing more than 666 issues. Statistical techniques successfully identified the various factors that leads to estimation inaccuracy related to issues as well as identified the hidden relationships existing among various variables. The employed predictive analytic models was also successful to some extent, in predicting effort estimation related inaccuracy associated with the issues. The insights provided by the entire data analytics study can be of great help to product managers or the developers to make more informed decisions. In addition, the guidelines presented in this paper based on the lessons learnt can be applied to other data analytics and academia-industry collaboration project.},

A vital first step toward closing the gap is fostering alumni engagement in industry and academia. Industry-academia collaborations are like earth and water, and they live in harmony. They cannot exist apart from one another. The collaborative effort between industry and academia promotes improvement and innovation in technology and innovative research and enables the university to be more relevant to the industry. This article proposes a collaborative approach based on alumni influences and uses secondary data on the influences of alumni in engineering to enrich the collaboration between industry and academia. The industry and academia utilize the alumni’s potential to facilitate communication and offer their students and staff facilities. The research findings can be used by policymakers to innovate in the field of engineering and to strengthen the partnership between industry and academia in society. The model enables academia and industry to utilize the alumni strengths in enriching the collaboration; it also enhances academic research output, recruitment, fundraising, marketing, product promotion, and internship opportunities for students via alumni active participation. We propose some significant agendas for future work.},

Combining social process modeling with theories of change and learning, we show how Anna and Lars responded to the experienced challenges and opportunities, how Anna's action strategies developed as she grew into becoming a practitioner-researcher, how the collaboration impacted the practice context, and, how the research resulted in traditional publication outcomes. On the basis of these analyses, we discuss how to engage professionally qualified doctoral students within the IS discipline.

 abstract = {To advance knowledge about evolution of practices within a software organisation, we offer a retrospective reflection based on several years of research into a software unit at Ericsson AB. Covering 16 years of evolution, we developed multiple publications from continuously expanding sources of software technology implementation data. While these publications report from specific junctures of software practice evolution at the unit, our retrospective reflection allows us to consider the impacts of the unit’s investments into two technology paradigms over the sixteen-year period: first into CMM-RUP with a focus on discipline and structured practices and years later into Agile-Lean with a focus on flexibility and responsive practices. Hence, we adopt retrospective reflection to investigate how imprints from the two paradigms, despite considerable timespan between the related technology implementations, eventually complemented each other in the unit’s software practices. Because one paradigm focuses on discipline and structured practices and the other on flexibility and responsive practices, our retrospective reflections consider how the two paradigms together impacted the software unit’s ambidextrous capability. As a result, we advance the idea that as software organisations over time invest in complementary technology paradigms they leave important technology traces with sustainable impacts on their software practices.},

 abstract = {Background
Metrics teams play an increasingly important role in handling data and information in modern software development organizations; they manage their companies’ measurement programs, collect and process data, and develop and distribute information products. Metrics teams can comprise several roles, and their set-up can differ between companies, as can the metrics maturity of host organizations. These differences impact the effectiveness and quality of a team’s measurement program.

Objective
Our objective was to design and evaluate a model to describe the characteristics of a mature metrics team, which efficiently designs, develops, maintains, and evolves its organization’s measurement program.

Method
We conducted an action research study on four metrics teams of four distinct companies. We designed and evaluated a domain-specific model for assessing the maturity of metrics teams – MeTeaM – and also assessed the four metrics teams per se.

Results
Our results were two-fold: the creation of the metrics team maturity model MeTeaM and a template to assess metrics teams. Our evaluation showed that the model captures the characteristics of successful metrics teams and quantifies the maturity status of both the metrics teams and their host organizations.

Conclusions
More mature metrics teams score higher in the MeTeaM model than less mature teams. The assessment provides less mature metrics teams with valuable insights on what factors to improve. Such insights can be shared with and acted upon successfully with their organizations.},

@article{Menon_2021,
 abstract = {Purpose
The study has a two-fold purpose: first, to identify the enablers of partnering agility in higher education, and, second, to analyze the interplay between the enablers.

Design/methodology/approach
Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) was used to construct a theoretical model of partnering agility enablers, and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank and segregate the enablers into independent, autonomous, dependent and linkage zones on the basis of their driving and dependence power.

Findings
The study helped in identifying eight enablers that can be instrumental in driving partnering agility in higher education. According to the TISM model, clarity on roles and responsibilities of partners was found to be the most crucial and vital enabler followed by resource sharing.

Practical implications
The conceptual model provides a new direction on how to develop and strengthen higher education partnerships. The model has prioritized all the crucial enablers that the management can work around in order to drive partnering agility in higher education institutions.

Originality/value
Studies in the past have majorly focused on academia–industry partnerships. This research has tried to provide a comprehensive view of the enablers and the multidirectional interplay between the enablers that can facilitate partnerships between academia and industry, Indian and international universities, and academia and community.},

Most often, organizations focus on scale and individual customer requests are viewed as problematic since they add complexity to product variation and version control. Here, we explore the use of customer-specific teams as a means to address this conflict. First, we verify the use of customer-specific teams as successful for improving customer responsiveness, customer satisfaction and feature quality through a case study at Ericsson. Second, we identify three approaches for how to organize feature development, and recommendations on how software development companies can efficiently use these to improve their practices. Third, we observe new business opportunities that arise when using customer-specific teams.},

This paper presents a method for prioritizing architectural concerns in the presence of heterogeneous stakeholder groups in large organizations that need to evolve existing architecture. The method involves enquiry, analysis, and deliberation using collaborative and analytical techniques. Method outcomes are action principles directed to managers, and assessment of user needs directed to architects, along with evidence. The method results from 4 years of action research at Ericsson AB with the purpose of adding missing views to architecture documentation and removing superfluous ones. It is illustrated on a case where 29 senior engineers and managers within Ericsson prioritized 37 architectural concerns areas to arrive at 8 action principles, 5 prioritized improvement areas, and 24 improvement suggestions. Feedback from the organization is that the method has been effective in prioritizing architectural concerns, that data collection and analysis is more extensive compared to traditional prioritization practices, but that extensive analysis seems inevitable in architecture improvement work.},

Agile development, continuous integration and testing are commonly used quality assurance techniques applied in industry. Increasing the level of test automation is a key ingredient to address the short release cycles. Testing at the graphical user interface (GUI) level is challenging to automate, and therefore many companies still do this manually. To help find solutions for better GUI test automation, academics are researching scriptless GUI testing to complement the script-based approach. In order to better match industrial problems with academic results, more academia-industry collaborations for case-based evaluations are needed. This paper describes such an initiative to improve, transfer and integrate an academic scriptless GUI testing tool TESTAR into the CI pipeline of a Spanish company Prodevelop. The paper describes the steps taken, the outcome, the challenges, and some lessons learned for successful industry-academia collaboration.},

Three of many possible answers to this question are (a) the intellectual exercise in developing/disseminating approaches that address emerging and existing challenges, (b) recognition from impact in a community of researchers and (c) widespread use of novel ideas, including software, in the society at large leading to enhancement of human ability and job creation. A culmination of these sources requires an organizational effort. This article presents a detailed account of a research-based innovation centre, Certus, to facilitate such a culmination for software engineering researchers. Certus has established a body of knowledge, methods and tools for the validation and verification of software systems in the Norwegian private and public sector. Certus works in close cooperation with five founding user partners and is hosted by the Simula Research Laboratory. We present the organizational structure of Certus and describe how Certus’s life and health is planned and evaluated on a regular basis as a research-based innovation centre. We expound two successful collaborations, with (a) the private sector entity Cisco systems, Norway and (b) the public sector entity the Norwegian Customs and Excise. We hope that this document will serve as a basis to encourage national/international funding schemes to create call for proposals for long-term research-based innovation centres. This, we believe, is one way to justify use of tax payers resources in creating a win–win situation for the triple helix: government, researchers and industry.},

We analyse industry-academia collaboration scenarios based on our own experiences as Ph.D. student and supervisor, and provide insights and recommendations to facilitate future collaborations with industry.

Method
We first present our industry-academia collaboration experiences that span over two and a half years with different companies. Then, we analyse both facilitators and problems from those scenarios and synthesize recommendations based on that.

Results
Five different scenarios are analysed, including both success and failure scenarios. Reflections and insights into these experiences as well as some general recommendations are presented.

Conclusion
We believe such experiences and insights are helpful for academic researchers to pursue industry-academia collaboration. We plan to continuously report our experience and provide our suggestions for effective collaboration with industry.},

It elaborates on how to find the right research activities and how to distinguish them from non-significant ones. Further, it details how to glean lessons from the research results, no matter whether they are positive or negative. Lastly, it shows how companies can evolve and build talents while expanding their product portfolio.

The book’s structure is based on that of AR projects; it sequentially covers and discusses each phase of the project. Each chapter shares new insights into AR and provides the reader with a better understanding of how to apply it. In addition, each chapter includes a number of practical use cases or examples. Taken together, the chapters cover the entire software lifecycle: from problem diagnosis to project (or action) planning and execution, to documenting and disseminating results, including validity assessments for AR studies.

The goal of this book is to help everyone interested in industry-academia collaborations to conduct joint research. It is for students of software engineering who need to learn about how to set up an evaluation, how to run a project, and how to document the results. It is for all academics who aren’t afraid to step out of their comfort zone and enter industry. It is for industrial researchers who know that they want to do more than just develop software blindly. And finally, it is for stakeholders who want to learn how to manage industrial research projects and how to set up guidelines for their own role and expectations.},
