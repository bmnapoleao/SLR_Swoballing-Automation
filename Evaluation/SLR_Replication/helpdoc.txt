Backward and Forward Snowballing (Rounds 1 to 5) + Seed iteration:
_______________________________________________________________

The input file:
---------------
1. links.txt: User created and defined file. Should contain the corresponding dois of the seed papers that
   need to be placed in the "links.txt" file of the root dir. The dois used for our experiment are in the 
   file "Links from Crossref.txt" and the actual references (string) of these dois are in the 
   "Round 1 Start set refs.txt" file.


The output files: 
-----------------
Backward Snowballing
===================
1. allbibs-back.bib - Contain the bibtex of the papers with dois, which are outgoing references to the seed set.

2. References-back.csv - Contain the status of the backward snowballing results for each paper.

Forward Snowballing
===================
1. allbibs-forw.bib - Contain the bibtex of the papers with dois, which are incoming citations to the seed set.

2. References-forw.csv - Contain the status of the forward snowballing results for each paper.

Round 0 - Seed Set
==================
1. allbibs-seed.bib - Contain the bibtex of the seed set papers with dois.

2. References-seed.csv - Contain the status of the bibtex extraction results for the seed set papers.
