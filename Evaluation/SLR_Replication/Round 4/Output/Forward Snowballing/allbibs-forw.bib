 abstract = {As we increasingly strive for scientific rigor and generalizability in HCI research, should we entertain any hope that by doing good science, our discoveries will eventually be more transferrable to industry? We present an in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process of transitioning from a university project to a revenue-generating startup financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of non-user-centered stakeholders. To make the research-to-product transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect to their potential for commercial impact.},

@article{Kalygina_2022,
 abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the prospects of the international transfer technologies in the Russian market. The sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU countries and the United States have led to a clear understanding of the danger of dependence on imports. In 2014, an import substitution program was launched by the Russian government, and it has already shown the positive results. Some industries showed the increasing the share of domestic products by 15-25% Nevertheless, simple import substitution can also have a negative impact on the enterprise. For example, it can decrease the productivity and the product quality. Not all enterprises can offer competitive products without imported components, technologies, and trained personnel, even for the domestic market. No doubt, the interests of domestic producers must be considered in the first place, but it is necessary to make sure that Russian products are also interesting for the foreign markets. That is why the government set the task of moving from the policy of simple import substitution to the policy of export-oriented import substitution. Russia should improve its performance in the export of non-resource goods. Unfortunately, simple localization can be quite risky for the economy. Russia should be more actively involved in international technology transfer. The article examines the weaknesses and strengths of the Russian innovation system, as well as the opportunities that open for Russian business and Swiss companies, that transforms innovative and patented technologies developed by Swiss universities and international research centers into global successful businesses.},

The framework is versatile and can be run on a variety of target systems including programmable logic controllers and distributed control system implementations. However, the main attractive property of the framework stems from the goal of achieving smooth technology transfer from the academic setting to real industrial applications. Technology transfer is, in general, difficult to achieve, because of the apparent disconnect between academic studies and actual industry. The proposed software framework aims at bridging this gap for model predictive control—a powerful control technique which can result in substantial performance improvement of industrial control loops, thus adhering to modern trends for reducing energy waste and fulfilling sustainable development goals. In the paper, the proposed solution is motivated and described, and experimental evidence of its successful deployment is provided using a real industrial plant.},

@article{Brings_2018,
 abstract = {Introduction
Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application.

Objective
This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering.

Method
We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis.

Results
Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer.

Conclusion
Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.},

However, conducting empirical studies is often cost-intensive; in particular in industrial environments. Therefore, we need to find a way to balance cost and value of empirical findings. In This work, we discuss a way of gathering required empirical data in software engineering education programs. Although an academic setting is not representative of industrial organizations, the information gathered there can help organizations to decide upon alternatives to improve current software engineering processes. We describe how a practical software engineering course for graduate students at the University of Kaiserslautern was used as a platform for validating software development approaches. As there are specific restrictions and constraints defined by this context, we discuss how they influence the design of empirical studies. In addition, we present a concrete example of comparing product line approaches.},
