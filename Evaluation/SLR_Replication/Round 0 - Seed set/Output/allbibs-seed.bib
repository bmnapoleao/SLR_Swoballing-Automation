 abstract = {Both the software industry and academia promote collaboration to solve challenges together that neither can solve alone. Collaboration brings opportunities to understand and improve in ways not possible when working apart, but it succeeds only if both parties are contributing. A collaboration model developed from eight years' experience setting up and managing a research center explicitly focused on industry needs is based on five success factors enabling research results (need orientation, industry goal alignment, deployment impact, industry benefit, and innovativeness), five success factors enabling research activities (management engagement, network access, collaborator match, communication ability, and continuity), and 10 action principles for industry-academia collaboration management.},

 abstract = {Software engineering research can be done in many ways, in particular it can be done in different ways when it comes to working with industry. This paper presents a list of top 10 challenges to work with industry based on our experience from working with industry in a very close collaboration with continuous exchange of knowledge and information. The top 10 list is based on a large number of research projects and empirical studies conducted with industrial research partners since 1983. It is concluded that close collaboration is a long-term undertaking and a large investment. The importance of addressing the top 10 challenges is stressed, since they form the basis for a long-term sustainable and successful collaboration between industry and academia.},

@inproceedings{Enoiu_2014,
 abstract = {hen it comes to industrial organizations, current collaboration efforts in software engineering research are very often kept in-house, depriving these organizations off the skills necessary to build independent collaborative research. The current trend, towards empirical software engineering research, requires certain standards to be established which would guide these collaborative efforts in creating a strong partnership that promotes independent, evidence-based, software engineering research. This paper examines key enabling factors for an efficient and effective industry-academia collaboration in the software testing domain. A major finding of the research was that while technology is a strong enabler to better collaboration, it must be complemented with industrial openness to disclose research results and the use of a dedicated tooling platform. We use as an example an automated test generation approach that has been developed in the last two years collaboratively with Bombardier Transportation AB in Sweden.},

In this paper we aim at defining those foundations by reflecting on the successful collaborative research projects we achieved.},

 abstract = {More and more, software engineering researchers are motivated to solve real problems that bring value to industry. An example is the industry-academia collaboration described in this paper among everis, an IT consulting firm, and the GESSI research group at UPC. The goal of this paper is twofold: to evaluate the success of the collaboration, and to report the experience with conducting empirical studies in the industry and lessons learnt. We evaluated our collaboration with an existing model for technology transfer, and performed a focus group discussion to identify challenges we have faced. After initialization and alignment of the collaboration, a high maturity level has been achieved: we have obtained the first results in form of proposed solutions, scientific publications, and pilots run in real projects. In spite of this positive progress, further initiatives need to be undertaken in the last phases of the collaboration to achieve high degrees of maturity in deployment impact, industry benefit and innovativeness. Evaluating the collaboration has been positive, since we identified the next steps to be taken to achieve a high degree of technology transfer and innovation dissemination. We think it is a needed step in industry-academia collaborations in order to improve their success.},

@inproceedings{Petersen_2014,
 abstract = {Background: Action research is a well-established research methodology. It is following a post-positivist research philosophy grounded in critical thinking. The methodology is driven by practical problems, emphasis participatory research, and develops practically useful solutions in an iterative manner.
Objective: Two objectives are to be achieved: (1) Understanding the state of the art with respect to action research usage in the software engineering literature, and (2) reflecting and providing recommendations of how to foster industry-academia collaboration through action research.
Method:} Based on our experience with two action research studies in close collaboration with Ericsson lessons learned and guidelines are presented.
Results: In both cases presented action research led to multiple refinements in the interventions implemented. Furthermore, the close collaboration and co-production with the industry was essential to identify and describe the required refinements to provide an in-depth understanding. In comparison with previous studies, we required multiple iterations while previous software engineering studies reported mostly one iteration, or were not explicit regarding the number of iterations studied.
Conclusion: We conclude that action research is a powerful tool for industry-academia collaboration. The success of the method highly depends on the researchers and practitioners working in a team. Future studies need to improve the reporting with respect to describing the type of action research used, the iterations, the model of collaboration, and the rationales for changes in each iteration.},

@inproceedings{Rodr_guez_2014,
 abstract = {Collaboration between industry practitioners and researchers has been reported as a challenge to conduct empirical studies in software engineering. Gaining practitioners interest in research activities is challenging in the software development industry characterized by tough competition and short time-to-market. Often, practitioners do not see the direct value in collaborating with researchers. Meanwhile, researchers are frequently frustrated because they have no access to the real-world data that would enable them to develop scientific knowledge. Design science has become a popular research framework in Information Systems. This paper describes our lessons learned on how design science can help to attract and motivate industry practitioners to take part in empirical research. We present our practical experiences with using design science in the context of empirical software engineering, and how the design science framework helped us to bridge the collaborative gap with our industry partners. In illustrating our experiences, we present two case studies conducted in collaboration with Ericsson and Elektrobit in which the design science framework was followed. Based on our experience, design science is a suitable research framework for empirical software engineering since much of the research in the field is constructive. The similarities between the design science practices and the day-to-day work of practitioners in industry make it easy for them to understand the research approach. Thus, it supports their willingness to participate in research activities.},

 abstract = {In industry–academia collaboration projects, there are many issues related to different time horizons in industry and academia. If not adressed upfront, they may hinder collabora-tion in such projects. We analyze our expe-riences from a 10 year industry–academia col-laboration program, the EASE Industrial Ex-cellence Center in Sweden, and identify issues and feasible practices to overcome the hur-dles of different time horizons. Specifically, we identify issues related to contracts, goals, re-sults, organization (in)stability, and work prac-tices. We identify several areas where the time horizon is different, and conclude that mutual awareness of these differences and management commitment to the collaboration are the key means to overcome the differences. The launch of a mediating institute may also be part of the solution.},

 abstract = {Industry–academia projects exist in complex contexts of various stakeholders, time perspec-tives, and goals. In order to analyze projects and communicate about them, we have de-fined an "architectural" model for industry– academia collaboration, inspired by Kruchten's software architecture model. The model has four views of i) time, ii) space, iii) activity and iv) domain, corresponding to the ques-tions: when, where, how and what. The +1 view is the scenario, binding the other four to-gether. We illustrate the model by applying it to the Industrial Excellence Center EASE and the Sigrun Software Innovation and En-gineering Institute. The model helps analyz-ing industry–academia collaboration projects, to find gaps and reduce redundant work.},
