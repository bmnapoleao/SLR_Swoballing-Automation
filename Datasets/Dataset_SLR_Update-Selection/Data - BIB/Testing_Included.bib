Despite many mutual benefits, this collaboration is often challenging, not only due to different goals, but also because of different pace in providing the results. The software development industry has during the last decade aligned around and organized their development adopting agile methodologies. For the researchers, the agile methodologies are a topic for a research, rather than a means of performing the research itself. We can state a question, whether the agile methodologies can be a good common ground for enabling successful research collaboration between industry and academia? This paper reports on a longitudinal industry - academia research collaboration case, which has stepwise adapted SCRUM over a six-year period. The implementation of SCRUM and the collaboration successes and challenges are presented, and findings are discussed.},

	abstract     = {Context Industry-academia collaboration (IAC) in the field of software engineering is widely discussed in the literature, highlighting its importance and benefits. However, along with the benefits, academic researchers face challenges while performing empirical studies in industry, risking their success. Awareness of these challenges and the importance of addressing them has recently grown, and became the center of discussion in several publication venues. Objective In this paper, we aim to address one of the key challenges affecting the success of IAC: stakeholder involvement. To this end, we propose a vision for leveraging organizational climate theory toward an effective management of IAC in software engineering research. Organizational climate is defined as the organization's priorities as perceived by its employees and was found to be an effective means of predicting employee behavior. Method To provide a basis and motivation for our vision, we conducted a literature review, focused on the workshop series of CESI, Conducting Empirical Studies in Industry, in order to elicit the relevant reported challenges of IAC, and to analyze them through the lens of the organizational climate theory. Results Emergent categories of the elicited challenges of IAC are related to the two basic components that determine the emergence of organizational climate: management commitment and communication. This result demonstrates that analyzing stakeholder involvement-related challenges of IAC through the lens of organizational climate theory provides an indication of the climate components that should be enhanced in order to address these challenges. Conclusion The above analysis lays the foundation for our vision that organizational climate may serve as an effective means of addressing the discussed challenges. We propose that developing measures of organizational research collaboration climate and deploying respective interventions for improvement would be instrumental for enhancing stakeholder involvement in IAC. We further propose a research outline toward fulfilling these potential contributions.}

The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to explore and characterize the state of IAC with respect to industrial needs, developed solutions, impacts of the projects and also a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) study. To address the above goal, we conducted an opinion survey among researchers and practitioners with respect to their experience in IAC. Our dataset includes 101 data points from IAC projects conducted in 21 different countries. Our findings include: (1) the most popular topics of the IAC projects, in the dataset, are: software testing, quality, process, and project managements; (2) over 90% of IAC projects result in at least one publication; (3) almost 50% of IACs are initiated by industry, busting the myth that industry tends to avoid IACs; and (4) 61% of the IAC projects report having a positive impact on their industrial context, while 31% report no noticeable impacts or were ?not sure?. To improve this situation, we present evidence-based recommendations to increase the success of IAC projects, such as the importance of testing pilot solutions before using them in industry. This study aims to contribute to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, and benefit researchers and practitioners. Using the data and evidence presented in this paper, they can conduct more successful IAC projects in SE by being aware of the challenges and how to overcome them, by applying best practices (patterns), and by preventing anti-patterns.}

However, building scalable and effective research collaborations in software engineering is known to be challenging. While such challenges can be varied and many, in this paper we focus on the challenges of achieving participative knowledge creation supported by active dialog between industry and academia and continuous commitment to joint problem solving. Objective This paper aims to understand what are the elements of a successful industry-academia collaboration that enable the culture of participative knowledge creation. Method We conducted participant observation collecting qualitative data spanning 8 years of collaborative research between a software engineering research group on software V&V and the Norwegian IT sector. The collected data was analyzed and synthesized into a practical collaboration model, named the Certus Model. Results The model is structured in seven phases, describing activities from setting up research projects to the exploitation of research results. As such, the Certus model advances other collaborations models from literature by delineating different phases covering the complete life cycle of participative research knowledge creation. Conclusion The Certus model describes the elements of a research collaboration process between researchers and practitioners in software engineering, grounded on the principles of research knowledge co-creation and continuous commitment to joint problem solving. The model can be applied and tested in other contexts where it may be adapted to the local context through experimentation.}

	abstract     = {Background: The literature concerning research methodologies and methods has increased in software engineering in the last decade. However, there is limited guidance on selecting an appropriate research methodology for a given research study or project. Objective: Based on a selection of research methodologies suitable for software engineering research in collaboration between industry and academia, we present, discuss and compare the methodologies aiming to provide guidance on which research methodology to choose in a given situation to ensure successful industryâ€“academia collaboration in research. Method: Three research methodologies were chosen for two main reasons. Design Science and Action Research were selected for their usage in software engineering. We also chose a model emanating from software engineering, i.e., the Technology Transfer Model. An overview of each methodology is provided. It is followed by a discussion and an illustration concerning their use in industryâ€“academia collaborative research. The three methodologies are then compared using a set of criteria as a basis for our guidance. Results: The discussion and comparison of the three research methodologies revealed general similarities and distinct differences. All three research methodologies are easily mapped to the general research process describeâ€“solveâ€“practice, while the main driver behind the formulation of the research methodologies is different. Thus, we guide in selecting a research methodology given the primary research objective for a given research study or project in collaboration between industry and academia. Conclusions: We observe that the three research methodologies have different main objectives and differ in some characteristics, although still having a lot in common. We conclude that it is vital to make an informed decision concerning which research methodology to use. The presentation and comparison aim to guide selecting an appropriate research methodology when conducting research in collaboration between industry and academia.}

	abstract     = {Background: Studies involving industry-academia collaboration (IAC) have been growing in recent years. On the one hand, scientific research is encouraged to solve real problems and, on the other, the sector in search of promoting innovation in its field. However, IAC support is still a challenging activity for Software Engineering (SE). In recent studies, the Action Research (AR) method has shown promising results in IAC projects. However, more research still needs to be done to verify the effects of applying this method. Goal: In this article, we investigate the perceptions of postgraduate students from an academic master?s and doctoral program in Computer Engineering at a Brazilian University, about the benefits and challenges faced with the application of the AR method as a strategy to promote IAC. Method: The case study was carried out with three teams of students conducting an AR in three software development companies (two private and one public). Results: As for the degree of satisfaction with the course, results revealed that 86% of the students were satisfied with the course. As for the Perception of learning with the use of AR, 100% of the students agreed that the AR method contributed positively to your learning. Conclusion: Finally, we conclude that conducting IAC projects using the AR method was a satisfactory, even though this task has been extremely challenging for all students. We observed that the reasons for this were, first, the fact that students have little experience with research methods directed to Empirical Software Engineering; second, due to the resistance faced in the industry to apply the AR method.},

To better understand what facilitates good IA communication and what project outcomes such communication promotes, we performed a case study, in the context of a long-term IA joint project, followed by a validating survey among practitioners and researchers with experience of working in similar settings. We identified five facilitators of IA communication and nine project outcomes related to this communication. The facilitators concern the relevance of the research, practitioners' attitude and involvement in research, frequency of communication and longevity of the collaboration. The project outcomes promoted by this communication include, for researchers, changes in teaching and new scientific venues, and for practitioners, increased awareness, changes to practice, and new tools and source code. Besides, both parties gain new knowledge and develop social-networks through IA communication. Our study presents empirically based insights that can provide advise on how to improve communication in IA research projects and thus the co-creation of software engineering knowledge that is anchored in both practice and research.}

Constrained by curtailed communication between researchers and practitioners, research conducted in a vacuum, or the "publish or perish" mindset, research collaborations between industry and academia often fail to deliver on the promise of creating a meaningful impact for practitioners. In an attempt to address these circumstances, this paper gives insights on applying research value co-creation to industry-academia collaboration in software engineering. We observe that the core of co-creation includes commitment, continuous engagement and alignment, aiming to produce value for both sides. Further we contend that co-creation has the potential to bridge the acknowledged research-practice collaboration gap through participative knowledge generation. Our experience stems from an eight-year long large collaborative project between a research organization and Norwegian software industry and public sector services. We suggest that for achieving research impact one needs to rethink the way industry and academia engage in and run collaborative projects. Traditional technology-transfer workflows where research is created in a lab and then pushed to industry practice do not stand the best chance of success. Instead, co-creating research with all stakeholders is likely to bring about the best research impact.},

The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to characterize a set of collaborative industry?academia R&D projects in the area of software testing conducted by the authors (based in Canada and Turkey) with respect to a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review study, with the aim of contributing to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, for the benefit of SE researchers and practitioners in conducting successful IAC projects in software testing and in software engineering in general. To address the above goal, a pool of ten IAC projects (six completed, two failed and two ongoing) all in the area of software testing, which the authors have led or have had active roles in, were selected as objects of study and were analyzed (both quantitatively and qualitatively) with respect to the set of selected challenges, patterns and anti-patterns. As outputs, the study presents a set of empirical findings and evidence-based recommendations, e.g.: it has been observed that even if an IAC project may seem perfect from many aspects, one single major challenge (e.g., disagreement in confidentiality agreements) can lead to its failure. Thus, we recommend that both parties (academics and practitioners) consider all the challenges early on and proactively work together to eliminate the risk of challenges in IAC projects. We furthermore report correlation and interrelationship of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns with project success measures. This study hopes to encourage and benefit other SE researchers and practitioners in conducting successful IAC projects in software testing and in software engineering in general in the future.}

SERP-test was constructed through a systematic and goal-oriented approach which included literature reviews and interviews with practitioners and researchers. SERP-test was evaluated through an online survey and by utilizing it in an industry?academia collaboration project. SERP-test comprises four facets along which both research contributions and practical challenges may be classified: Intervention, Scope, Effect target and Context constraints. This paper explains the available categories for each of these facets (i.e., their definitions and rationales) and presents examples of categorized entities. Several tasks may benefit from SERP-test, such as formulating research goals from a problem perspective, describing practical challenges in a researchable fashion, analyzing primary studies in a literature review, or identifying relevant points of comparison and generalization of research.}

This work enhances the existing body of literature and knowledge regarding collaboration and offers concrete steps to be taken for effective collaboration between universities and industries. Research Methodology ? A literature review to study the best practices, impediments to collaboration and the various models proposed in the past for successful UIC was conducted. A workshop and focus-group meetings of practitioners and academic researchers was designed and organised to explore the current state of the university?industry engagement within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region and gather inputs regarding possible approaches to improve collaboration. The findings from the literature review and the results from this qualitative research regarding the approaches to improve the effectiveness of the collaboration were analysed. Results and implications ? The study discovers that various measures have been proposed in the form of best practices or models to improve the effectiveness of UIC. However, these measures often address a specific concern such as technology transfer, intellectual property (IP), etc. There is a scope for a comprehensive holistic framework to address many aspects of UIC in order to improve effectiveness and achieve success. A framework for improving the effectiveness of collaboration considering a comprehensive list of factors operating in a broad context within the collaboration system was proposed. Originality/value ? The framework builds on previous literature dealing with measures for successful UIC. However, it is the first of its kind, in the researcher's knowledge, in terms of comprehensiveness of the factors contributing to establishing and sustaining successful collaboration. The value of the individual experience of the participants in this qualitative research, which is on average more than 10 years in the software engineering field, validates the importance and quality of the data collected. The addition of these results to the framework increases its validity.The framework can be utilised by universities and industry practitioners to foster successful and effective collaboration. The results have significant relevance, particularly within the Australian context as the government has intensified the adoption of measures to encourage and improve collaboration between universities and the industry.}

	abstract     = {Context: Traditional technology transfer models rely on the assumption that innovations are created in academia, after which they are transferred to industry using a sequential flow of activities. This model is outdated in contemporary software engineering research that is done in close collaboration between academia and industry and in large consortia rather than on a one-on-one basis. In the new setup, research can be viewed as continuous co-experimentation, where industry and academia closely collaborate and iteratively and jointly discover problems and develop, test, and improve solutions. Objective: The objective of the paper is to answer the following research questions: How can high-quality, ambitious software engineering research in a collaborative setup be conducted quickly and on a large scale? How can real-time business feedback to continuously improve candidate solutions be gained? Method: The proposed model has been created, refined, and evaluated in two large, national Finnish software research programs. For this paper, we conducted thematic interviews with representatives of four companies who participated in these programs. Results: The fundamental change is in the mindset of the participants from technology push by academia to technology pull by companies, resulting in co-creation. Furthermore, continuous cooperation between participants enables solutions to evolve in rapid cycles and forms a scalable model of interaction between research institutes and companies. Conclusions: The multifaceted nature of software engineering research calls for numerous approaches. In particular, when working with human-related topics such as company culture and development methods, many discoveries result from seamless collaboration between companies and research institutes.}

	abstract     = {Background: Technology transfer is one key to the success of research projects, especially in Software Engineering, where the (practical) impact of the outcome may depend not only on the reliability and feasibility of technologies, but also on their applicability to industrial settings. However, there is limited knowledge on the current state of practice and how to assess the success of technology transfer. Objective: We aim at elaborating a set of hypotheses on how technology transfer takes place in Software Engineering research projects. Method: We designed an exploratory survey with the participants of two large research projects in Germany, which involve both industrial and academic partners in the area of model driven development for embedded systems. Results: Base on the extracted respondents answers of this survey, we defined a resulting theory which is based on the following set of main hypothesis: Most of the technologies developed in research projects are not mature enough for a direct application, but need post-project customisation to fit the industrial contexts (H1). Common models that represent technology transfer as a transaction of an object from a transferor to a transferee does not fit industrial reality (H2). Additionally, technology transfer takes place without an explicit process (H3). Regarding transfer mediums, most used mediums are human-intensive (H5) and industry organisations gain new knowledge mainly within their own confines (H4). Finally the motivations that drive the transfer in industry and academia are heterogenous (H6). Conclusions: From the theoretical perspective, this theory and set of hypotheses extracted from the survey results will be further explored and tested in different follow-up activities. This initial set, however, already may serve as a basis for independent assessments from other researchers to collaboratively shed light on a how technology transfer takes place in Software Engineering research projects, which are the barriers, and how to improve the transfer into practice. From the practical perspective, our results may be used as a basis for an evaluation framework for the transfer of the developed technologies in our projects. This would also help companies in getting new developed technologies transfer easier to their specific context.}

In this chapter, we use the design science paradigm as a frame for articulating and communicating prescriptive software engineering research contributions. Design science embraces problem conceptualization, solution (or artifact) design, and validation of solution proposals, with recommendations for practice phrased as technological rules. Design science is used in related research areas, particularly information systems and management theory. We elaborate the constructs of design science for software engineering, relate them to different conceptualizations of design science, and provide examples of possible research methods. We outline how the assessment of research contributions, industry?academia communication, and theoretical knowledge building may be supported by the design science paradigm. Finally, we provide examples of software engineering research presented through a design science lens.}

We took this into account as we carried out the COMPETISOFT research project, which investigated software process improvement (SPI) in the context of Latin American small companies. That experience has enabled us to develop a research strategy based on the integrated use of action research and case study methods. This paper introduces the proposed research strategy and provides extensive discussion of its application for: (1) developing the Methodological framework of COMPETISOFT for SPI, (2) putting this framework into practice in eight small software companies, and (3) refine the Methodological framework due to the practice feedback. The use of this research strategy allowed us to observe that it was suitable for developing, refining, improving, applying, and validating COMPETISOFT?s Methodology framework. Furthermore, having seen it applied, we believe that this strategy offers a successful integration of action research and case study, which can be useful for conducting research in other software engineering areas which address needs of small software companies.}

	abstract     = {The relevance of context is particularly stressed in case studies, where it is said that â€œcase study is an empirical method aimed at investigating contemporary phenomena in their contextâ. In this research, we classify context information and provide a context checklist for industrial software engineering. The checklist serves the purpose of (a) supporting researchers and practitioners in characterizing the context in which they are working; (b) supporting researchers with a checklist to identify relevant contextual information to elicit and report during primary and secondary studies. We utilized a systematic approach for constructing the classification of context information and provided a detailed definition for each item. We collected feedback from researchers as well as practitioners. The usefulness of the checklist was perceived more positively by researchers than practitioners, though they highlighted benefits (raising awareness of the importance of context and usefulness for management). The understandability was perceived positively by both practitioners and researchers. The checklist may serve as a meta-model, forming the basis for specific adaptations for different research areas, and as input for researchers deciding which context information to extract in systematic reviews. The checklist may also help researchers in reporting context in research papers.}

It has been employed in the industry for more than a decade. Nevertheless, there are still challenges regarding its application in different domains. Some of these challenges are general, while some others are domain-specific. In this paper, we explain our experiences in enhancing model-based testing for its adoption in the consumer electronics domain, in particular for Digital TV systems. We applied the so-called industry-as-laboratory approach to define/refine research problems and evaluate our research results. We summarize these results and provide an evaluation of relevant research problems for our context. We observed that the industry-as-laboratory approach is highly effective for industry-academia collaboration and technology transfer in the scope of model-based software testing.}
