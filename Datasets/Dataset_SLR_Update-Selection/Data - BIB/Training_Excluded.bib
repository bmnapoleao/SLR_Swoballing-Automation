Empirical evidence through industry application, and in particular methodological guidance of how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models is needed. The overall aim of this work is to provide guidance to practitioners how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models, understanding strengths and weaknesses of alternative structures. The research was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the context situation was understood using interviews and workshops. In the second phase, possible structures of product lines and feature models were evaluated based on industry feedback collected in workshops. In the third phase, the structures were implemented in the tool GEARS and practitioner feedback was collected. One key challenge was the unavailability of structuring guidelines, which was the focus of this research. The structures considered most suitable for the automotive product line were multiple product lines with modular decomposition. The structures most suitable for the feature model were functional decomposition, using context variability, models corresponding to assets, and feature categories. Other structures have been discarded, and the rationales have been presented. It was possible to support the most suitable structures with the commercial tool GEARS. The implementation in GEARS and the feedback from the practitioners provide early indications for the potential usefulness of the structures and the tool implementation.}

Tailored for analyzing sustainability, it can offer tangible insights on potential benefits and risks of a system under development. However, as of now there is still relatively little empirical evidence available that would prove this quality, flexibility, and insight potential. Previous studies, specifically on the first two characteristics, differ in their socio-economic contexts and make the findings hard to generalize. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the advantages and limitations in the application of artifact-based requirements engineering by new, inexperienced requirements engineers to extend our family of studies. In addition, the secondary goal is to evaluate the suitability of the sustainability analysis artifact for a sustainability analysis of the system planned for development. Method: We report on a new member in a family of studies with 20 participants for evaluating artifact models in a sustainability application context. We use a graduate block course as case. Our data collection is performed via survey at the end of the course, based on the same instrument used in previous studies, and extended with a new section on evaluating the suitability of a particular artifact for sustainability analysis. Results: Both from the quantitative and the qualitative feedback, the results indicate that the students have benefitted from the artifact-based approach to analyzing sustainability in requirements engineering. Usability, syntactic and semantic quality were all rated high and the rationales were positive, as was the feedback on the sustainability analysis artifact. Conclusion: The results contribute to a reliable database on artifact-oriented requirements engineering and strengthen our confidence in the general benefits of artifact-orientation. Relating the old and new data provides some more insight into the trajectory of the wider transfer of artifact-based requirements engineering into practice.}

Although there are notable exceptions, this separation is substantial, which hinders a successful academy-industry collaboration, and communication about the demand and supply of research in software testing. This paper reviews 101 conferences: two thirds are academic ones, the rest being industrial. Besides providing this reasonably comprehensive list, we analyze any visible synergies such as events that have a mixed Program Committee and offer a program with elements from both sides. We found only a handful of such events, but these can serve both as opportunities for attendees who wish to extend their perspectives and as models for organizers of future conferences.},

This paper shows ways in which core principles of the project management approach, Agile, and the Scrum framework have been applied and have led to the success of three IARCs. In addition to IARCs' common challenges, these case studies represented additional challenges as they were short-term software development projects accomplished by small geographically distributed teams. A report of the demographic, collaboration setting, and challenges, along with the lessons learned from the application of Agile and Scrum in these case studies will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of IARCs. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, five Agile/Scrum aspects for each project are assessed: product ownership, release, sprint, team, and technical health. Findings indicate several success factors directly linked to the application of the Agile principles and the Scrum framework. Specifically, early and frequent customer-centric software delivery, constant communications, responsiveness to change, and highly motivated individuals were key in terms of realizing the positive outcomes in spite of the obstacles inherent to IARCs. Cautions to this approach when applied in IARCs are reported along with solutions.}

A special antenna is required in Cognitive Radio applications for spectrum sensing and communicating. Wide Band antennas are being considered as the most suitable structures for spectrum sensing applications and are perfectly suitable these environments. In this paper, an attempt is made to present the design of simple patch antenna structures by using circular, semi-circular, Semi-circular triangle shaped, semi-circular crown shaped antennas for achieving the wide band characteristics. These structures were analyzed theoretically and the simulation was done by using CST Microwave Studio Suite. All the structures were fabricated and analyzed in between 1-18 GHz frequency range on RT-Duroid substrate. It is found that these Structures achieve an enhanced impedance bandwidth over the frequency ranges other than Ultra Wide Band (UWB) range and up to Ku Band.},

The unit of analysis of our study is a family of software products (Geographic Information System- and Mobile-based Workforce Management Systems) that aim to address sustainability goals (e.g., efficient collection of dead animals to mitigate social and environmental sustainability risks). The results show that the sustainability&ndash;quality model integrated with the architectural decision maps can be used to identify sustainability&ndash;quality requirements as design concerns because most of its quality attributes (QAs) have been either addressed in the software project or acknowledged as relevant (i.e., creating awareness on the relevance of the multidimensional sustainability nature of certain QAs). Moreover, the action&ndash;research method has been helpful to enrich the sustainability&ndash;quality model, by identifying missing QAs (e.g., regulation compliance, data privacy). Finally, the architectural decision maps have been found as useful to guide software architects/designers in their decision-making process.}

Data pipeline failure due to faults at different stages of data pipelines is a common challenge that eventually leads to significant performance degradation of data-intensive systems. To ensure early detection of these faults and to increase the quality of the data products, continuous monitoring and fault detection mechanism should be included in the data pipeline. In this study, we have explored the need for incorporating automated fault detection mechanisms and mitigation strategies at different stages of the data pipeline. Further, we identified faults at different stages of the data pipeline and possible mitigation strategies that can be adopted for reducing the impact of data pipeline faults thereby improving the quality of data products.

Objective: Based on a selection of research methodologies suitable for software engineering research in collaboration between industry and academia, we present, discuss and compare the methodologies aiming to provide guidance on which research methodology to choose in a given situation to ensure successful industry?academia collaboration in research. Method: Three research methodologies were chosen for two main reasons. Design Science and Action Research were selected for their usage in software engineering. We also chose a model emanating from software engineering, i.e., the Technology Transfer Model. An overview of each methodology is provided. It is followed by a discussion and an illustration concerning their use in industry?academia collaborative research. The three methodologies are then compared using a set of criteria as a basis for our guidance. Results: The discussion and comparison of the three research methodologies revealed general similarities and distinct differences.

Thus, we guide in selecting a research methodology given the primary research objective for a given research study or project in collaboration between industry and academia. Conclusions: We observe that the three research methodologies have different main objectives and differ in some characteristics, although still having a lot in common. We conclude that it is vital to make an informed decision concerning which research methodology to use. The presentation and comparison aim to guide selecting an appropriate research methodology when conducting research in collaboration between industry and academia.}

The MBT approach has provided, so far in our project, various tangible and intangible benefits in terms of improved test coverage (number of paths tested), improved test-design practices, and also improved real-fault detection effectiveness. The goal of this experience report (applied research report), done based on ?action research?, is to share our experience of applying and evaluating MBT as a software technology (technique and tool) in a real industrial setting. We aim at contributing to the body of empirical evidence in industrial application of MBT by sharing our industry-academia project on applying MBT in practice, the insights that we have gained, and the challenges and questions that we have faced and tackled so far. We discuss an overview of the industrial setting, provide motivation, explain the events leading to the outcomes, discuss the challenges faced, summarize the outcomes, and conclude with lessons learned, take-away messages, and practical advices based on the described experience. By learning from the best practices in this paper, other test engineers could conduct more mature MBT in their test projects.}

To ensure early detection of erroneous data and avoid training MLmodels using bad data, research and industrial practice suggest incorporating a data validation process and tool in the ML system development process. Aim: The study investigates the adoption of a data validation process and tool in industrial ML projects. The data validation process demands significant engineering resources for tool development and maintenance. Thus, it is important to identify the best practices for their adoption especially by development teams that are in the early phases of deploying ML-enabled software systems. Method: Action research was conducted at a large-software intensive organization in telecommunications, specifically within the analytics R&D organization for an ML use case of classifying faults from returned hardware telecommunication devices. Results: Based on the evaluation results and learning from our action research, we identified three best practices, three benefits, and two barriers to adopting the data validation process and tool in ML projects. We also propose a data validation framework(DVF) for systematizing the adoption of a data validation process. Conclusions: The results show that adopting a data validation process and tool in ML projects is an effective approach to testing ML-enabled software systems. It requires having an overview of the level of data (feature, dataset, cross-dataset, data stream) at which certain data quality tests can be applied.},

However, the growing complexity of the systems and the uncertainty about the context in which they are used, create a need to augment qualitative data with quantitative data, collected during real-world driving. In contrast to many digital companies that are already successfully using data-driven methods, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are not yet succeeding in releasing the potentials such methods offer. We aim to understand what prevents automotive OEMs from applying data-driven methods, what needs practitioners formulate, and how collecting and analyzing usage data from vehicles can enhance UX activities. We adopted a Multiphase Mixed Methods approach comprising two interview studies with more than 15 UX practitioners and two action research studies conducted with two different OEMs. From the four studies, we synthesize the needs of UX designers, extract limitations within the domain that hinder the application of data-driven methods, elaborate on unleveraged potentials, and formulate recommendations to improve the usage of vehicle data. We conclude that, in addition to modernizing the legal, technical, and organizational infrastructure, UX and Data Science must be brought closer together by reducing silo mentality and increasing interdisciplinary collaboration. New tools and methods need to be developed and UX experts must be empowered to make data-based evidence an integral part of the UX design process.}

	abstract	 = {Context: Automated acceptance testing has become a relevant practice of agile software development (e.g., Extreme Programming). Automated acceptance tests (AATs) are closely tied to requirements and provide a mechanism for continuous validation of requirements as system-level tests. Studies have shown that these tests are costly to develop, maintain, and reuse.Objectives: This thesis examines and supports the systematic reuse of automated acceptance tests by providing approaches to search, identity, adapt reusable test cases while considering the reuse costs. Additionally, the maintainability and usage of automated acceptance tests in largescale software projects are studied.Method: We used various research methods to investigate development, reuse, and maintaining the automated acceptance tests. Workshops and interviews of practitioners were used to identify the benefits and challenges of automated acceptance tests. Next, method engineering was used to construct a systematic reuse process for automated acceptance tests. Qualitative feedback collected using a survey, and industrial demonstration examined the reuse process?s performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and necessary facilitating conditions. Two systematic literature reviews are used to identify techniques to adapt tests for future reuse opportunities and calculate the reuse costs of automated acceptance tests. Later, we developed and evaluated an approach for refactoring behavior-driven development-based automated acceptance tests using action research.Results: A cost-aware systematic reuse process was constructed to support the reuse of automated acceptance tests containing eleven activities. For each activity, guidelines on expected input, expected output, the actors performing the activity, and techniques (automated using scripts) are suggested and evaluated. The techniques involve approaches to support development for reuse and methods to calculate the costs of reusing automated acceptance tests. The industrial evaluation of the reuse process and the techniques showed its usefulness and relevance for the industry. Furthermore, seven challenges (i.e., the scale of the software projects, ownership, lack of competence, cost benefits, specification of behaviors in large-scale projects, difficulty writing system-level test-cases, and versioning control of behaviors) and five benefits (i.e., understanding of a business aspect of requirements, improved quality of requirements, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts in large-scale projects, and help for test organization.) of using automated acceptance tests in large-scale projects are identified with software practitioners? help. Later, we proposed a semiautomated four-step approach for pre-processing, measuring, ranking, and identifying refactoring candidates. The approach and the two proposed measures were successfully evaluated using two industrial projects. It was noted that similarity measures could support the maintenance of the specification base using refactoring.Conclusions: The studies show that automated acceptance tests are reusable and can be refactored using our proposed approach. The evaluation shows that the results apply to the software industry in the evaluated context. However, further work is required to evaluate the reuse process in different contexts.},

Problem: There is a significant demand for empirical studies for the understanding of the impacts and efficacy of gamification. However, the lack of standard procedures and models for the evaluation of gamification is a challenge for the design, comparison, and report of results related to the assessment of gamification approaches and its effects. Goal: The goal of this study is to identify models and strategies for the evaluation of gamification reported in the literature. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted a systematic mapping study to investigate strategies for the evaluation of gamification in the context of software engineering. We selected 100 primary studies on gamification in software engineering (from 2011 to 2020). We categorized the studies regarding the presence of evaluation procedures or models for the evaluation of gamification, the purpose of the evaluation, the criteria used, the type of data, instruments, and procedures for data analysis. Results: Our results show that 64 studies report procedures for the evaluation of gamification. However, only three studies actually propose evaluation models for gamification. We observed that the evaluation of gamification focuses on two aspects: the evaluation of the gamification strategy itself, related to the user experience and perceptions; and the evaluation of the outcomes and effects of gamification on its users and context. The most recurring criteria for the evaluation are "engagement", "performance", "satisfaction", and "motivation". Finally, the evaluation of gamification requires a mix of subjective and objective inputs, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches. Depending of the focus of the evaluation (the strategy or the outcomes), there is a predominance of a type of data and analysis.},

	abstract	 = {Due to the increasing prevalence of laws, standards, and ethical discussions about web accessibility, developing websites and apps that are usable to everyone?regardless of disability and impairment?is more important than ever. In spite of this, most of the web is still inaccessible and accessibility is commonly treated as an afterthought. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how to implement web accessibility as a cornerstone of software development processes, and more specifically what motivates accessibility adoption and how to implement it successfully.The main part of the research consists of an extensive analysis of the literature to identify common themes. Although legislation and financial concerns play a role in why organizations adopt accessibility, the most frequently cited factors are social and ethical aspects as well as reaching a wider audience. The success of accessibility implementation is largely dependent on how knowledge is created, maintained, and disseminated in organizations. Prioritizing it and integrating it as much as any other basic requirement is also a key to success. Moreover, WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the recommended accessibility standard and compliance level, as informed by a law review and insights from literature. In addition, semi-structured interviews and a workshop were conducted with participants across three projects of a Swedish IT company with the aim of applying the findings in a real-life context and bringing about change in the organization.Final suggestions were based on the thematic analysis, and adapted to the case company through the insights from interviews and the workshop, as well as process documentation and corporate policies. Although not generalizable to all organizations, the suggestions provide understanding of enterprises sharing the case company?s characteristics. Furthermore, the thematic analysis and law review have relevance for all types of private organizations.}

Extensive risk management (RM) protocol notwithstanding, accidents still occur [2, 3], with 75% deriving from human factors [4, 5]. In a fundamentally people-based industry, RM and the Human Element, and therefore potential Human Error (HE), are intrinsically linked. Maritime RM is highly regulated with the ISM Code, MARPOL, SOLAS, and the IMO?s Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) process all examples of the regulations and guidelines designed to proactively offset risk and prevent tragedy. Nevertheless, traditional maritime sector RM protocol relies heavily upon historical data which, in addition to the inherent undesirability of dependency, involves multiple other weaknesses. HE has been likened to a breakdown in technical reliability [7] where humans, in their susceptibility to inappropriate response in the face of disturbances to normal operations, act essentially as risk factors [6]. Recent perspectives on safety increasingly consider the Human Element as only one of a ?network of errors? in a safety causation chain [7, p. 14]. In the Arctic, where unknowns are extensive and experience navigating them is not, this distinction is especially noteworthy. Strengthened and deeper connection with the Human Element, in conjunction with databank reinforcement and population, therefore appear fundamental to safety improvement efforts [6]. With particular focus on the Arctic, this paper explores whether Action Research is an appropriate methodology to (i) improve facilitation of tasks identified as necessary to mitigating the insufficiency of existing historical databases and (ii) contribute to safety improvement efforts and augment current RM protocol by bringing together the knowledge base of maritime stakeholders as representatives of the Human Element. 18th Annual General Assembly 2017 International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU)}

	abstract     = {Context: Companies are increasingly collecting data from all possible sources to extract insights that help in data-driven decision-making. Increased data volume, variety, and velocity and the impact of poor quality data on the development of data products are leading companies to look for an improved data management approach that can accelerate the development of high-quality data products. Further, AI is being applied in a growing number of fields, and thus it is evolving as a horizontal technology. Consequently, AI components are increasingly been integrated into embedded systems along with electronics and software. We refer to these systems as AI-enhanced embedded systems. Given the strong dependence of AI on data, this expansion also creates a new space for applying data management techniques.  Objective: The overall goal of this thesis is to empirically identify the data management challenges encountered during the development and maintenance of AI-enhanced embedded systems, propose an improved data management approach and empirically validate the proposed approach. Method: To achieve the goal, we conducted this research in close collaboration with Software Center companies using a combination of different empirical research methods: case studies, literature reviews, and action research. Results and conclusions: This research provides five main results. First, it identifies key data management challenges specific to Deep Learning models developed at embedded system companies. Second, it examines the practices such as DataOps and data pipelines that help to address data management challenges. We observed that DataOps is the best data management practice that improves the data quality and reduces the time tdevelop data products. The data pipeline is the critical component of DataOps that manages the data life cycle activities. The study also provides the potential faults at each step of the data pipeline and the corresponding mitigation strategies. Finally, the data pipeline model is realized in a small piece of data pipeline and calculated the percentage of saved data dumps through the implementation. Future work: As future work, we plan to realize the conceptual data pipeline model so that companies can build customized robust data pipelines. We also plan to analyze the impact and value of data pipelines in cross-domain AI systems and data applications. We also plan to develop AI-based fault detection and mitigation system suitable for data pipelines.},

Objective This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering. Method We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis. Results Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer. Conclusion Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.}

Although design processes of industry engineers have been examined in multiple research studies, few studies have investigated design processes of academic engineers. As academia and industry have different sociocultural norms and constraints, their design processes likely also differ. To examine this question, we conducted semi-structured interviews with both academic and industry engineers who had successfully designed medical devices. Our qualitative findings revealed that engineers in industry described their design process as a sequence with problem definition, solution exploration, detail design, evaluation, and communication. Academic engineers, in contrast, described their design process as beginning with a discovered solution, then searching for application problems, evaluating compatibility between problems and solution, and finally, communicating their findings through publications. Understanding differences in design processes of academic and industry engineers can facilitate knowledge sharing and promote collaboration between academia and industry. The findings also highlight the impact of sociocultural norms on practices, even in disciplines with highly trained and clearly defined processes.},

These perspectives focus on different facets according to which knowledge can be analysed, in addition to provide a foundation for a better awareness on knowledge and the necessary treatment. This study presents an empirical study with the purpose of evaluating the relevance of these perspectives by using a survey questionnaire distributed to software development companies in the Brazilian market. Three hundred thirty nine individuals from different 339 companies were subjects of such a study. The results indicate that the perspectives are relevant for evaluating knowledge and reinforcing the relevance of exploring knowledge capitalisation in software development; therefore, there is a clear understanding of how the knowledge assets involved can be analysed or assessed.}

Objective: In this paper, we review practices, challenges, and success factors for scaling agile both from literature and within a large software company, identifying the most critical factors. Method: We conduct a focused literature review to map the importance of scaling practices, challenges, and success factors. The outcome of this focused literature review is used to guide action research within a software company with a view to scaling agile processes. Results: Company culture, prior agile and lean experience, management support, and value unification were found to be key success factors during the action research process. Resistance to change, an overly aggressive roll-out time frame, quality assurance concerns, and integration into preexisting nonagile business processes were found to be the critical challenges in the scaling process. Conclusion: The action research process allowed to cross-fertilize ideas from literature to the company's context. Scaling agile within an organization does not need to follow a specific scheme, rather the process can be tailored to the needs while keeping the core values and principles of agile methodologies.}

The bibliometric analysis has been conducted based on the number of papers published in the software-engineering-related venues and indexed in the Scopus academic search engine until year 2014. According to the bibliometric analysis, the top-ranked institution is Middle East Technical University, and the top-ranked scholar is Ay{\c{s}}e Ba{\c{s}}ar Bener (formerly with Bo{\u{g}}azi{\c{c}}i University and now with Ryerson University in Canada). The analysis reveals other important findings and presents a set of implications for the Turkish SE community and stakeholders (e.g., funding agencies and decision makers) such as the followings: (1) Turkey produces only about 0.49 {\%} of the world-wide SE knowledge, as measured by the number of papers in Scopus, which is very negligible unfortunately. To take a more active role in the global SE community, the Turkish SE community has to increase their outputs. (2) We notice a lack of diversity in the general SE spectrum, e.g., we noticed very little focus on requirements engineering, software maintenance and evolution, and architecture. This denotes the need to further diversification in SE research topics in Turkey. (3) In total, 89 papers in the pool (30.8 {\%} of the total) are internationally-authored SE papers. Having a good level of international collaborations is a good sign for the Turkish SE community. The highest international collaborations have been with researchers from United States, Canada and Netherlands. (4) In general, the involvement of industry in SE search is low. All stakeholders (e.g., government, industry and academia) should aim at increasing the level of industry-academia collaboration in the Turkish SE community, (5) Citation to Turkish SE papers, in general, are significantly lower than a set of three representative pools of SE papers. This is an area of concern which needs further investigation, and (6) In general, there is a need to increase both the quantity and quality of the Turkish SE papers, in the global stage. The approach we use in this study could be replicated in other countries to provide insights and trends about the SE research performance in other countries.}

	abstract     = {Background: Cost avoidance through reuse shows the benefits gained by the software organisations when reusing an artefact. Cost avoidance captures benefits that are not captured by cost savings e.g. spending that would have increased in the absence of the cost avoidance activity. This type of benefit can be combined with quality aspects of the product e.g. costs avoided because of defect prevention. Cost avoidance is a key driver for software reuse. Objectives: The main objectives of this study are: (1) To assess the status of capturing cost avoidance through reuse in the academia; (2) Based on the first objective, propose improvements in capturing of reuse cost avoidance, integrate these into an instrument, and evaluate the instrument in the software industry. Method: The study starts with a systematic literature review (SLR) on capturing of cost avoidance through reuse. Later, a solution is proposed and evaluated in the industry to address the shortcomings identified during the systematic literature review. Results: The results of a systematic literature review describe three previous studies on reuse cost avoidance and show that no solution, to capture reuse cost avoidance, was validated in industry. Afterwards, an instrument and a data collection form are proposed that can be used to capture the cost avoided by reusing any type of reuse artefact. The instrument and data collection form (describing guidelines) were demonstrated to a focus group, as part of static evaluation. Based on the feedback, the instrument was updated and evaluated in industry at 6 development sites, in 3 different countries, covering 24 projects in total. Conclusion: The proposed solution performed well in industrial evaluation. With this solution, practitioners were able to do calculations for reuse costs avoidance and use the results as decision support for identifying potential artefacts to reuse.},

Contribution: In this study the authors aimed at evaluating the ease of implementing a semantic knowledge management system at Ericsson, including the essential components of such systems (such as text processing, ontologies, semantic annotation and semantic search). Thereafter, feedback on the usefulness of the system was collected from practitioners. Method: A single case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB in Sweden. Results: It was found that semantic knowledge management systems are challenging to implement, this refers in particular to the implementation and integration of ontologies. Specific ontologies for structuring and filtering are essential, such as domain ontologies and ontologies distinct to the organization. Conclusion: To be readily adopted and transferable to practice, desired ontologies need to be implemented and integrated into semantic knowledge management frameworks with ease, given that the desired ontologies are dependent on organizations and domains.},

Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.}

It involves the expensive undertaking of rerunning test cases. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of test cases to execute in regression testing, however, there is no research on how to assess industrial relevance and applicability of such techniques. We conducted a systematic literature review with the following two goals: firstly, to enable researchers to design and present regression testing research with a focus on industrial relevance and applicability and secondly, to facilitate the industrial adoption of such research by addressing the attributes of concern from the practitioners' perspective. Using a reference-based search approach, we identified 1068 papers on regression testing. We then reduced the scope to only include papers with explicit discussions about relevance and applicability (i.e. mainly studies involving industrial stakeholders). Uniquely in this literature review, practitioners were consulted at several steps to increase the likelihood of achieving our aim of identifying factors important for relevance and applicability. We have summarised the results of these consultations and an analysis of the literature in three taxonomies, which capture aspects of industrial-relevance regarding the regression testing techniques. Based on these taxonomies, we mapped 38 papers reporting the evaluation of 26 regression testing techniques in industrial settings.}

Especially, retail customers of SAP deal with millions of sales transactions for their day-to-day business. Transactions are created during retail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and then sent to some central servers for validations and other business operations. A considerable proportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies due to many technical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error detection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using workbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to further errors due to incorrect modifications. This is not only a performance overhead on the customers' business workflow but it also incurs high operational costs. Thus, automated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important regarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business workflow. In this paper, we present an industrial case study where we apply machine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. We identify and discuss the challenges that we faced during this collaborative research and development project, from three distinct perspectives: Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and industry-academia collaboration. We report on our experience and insights from the project with guidelines for the identified challenges. We believe that our findings and recommendations can help researchers and practitioners embarking into similar endeavors.}

This paper studies 345 releases of a large e-commerce web app over a period of 1.5 years, in which we identified 17 recurrent root causes of botched releases, classified into four major categories. We then build explanatory models to understand which root causes are the most important, and to explore the factors leading to botched releases.},

This has led to a proliferation of software reliability models to estimate and predict reliability. The basic approach is to model past failure data to predict future behavior. Most of the models have three major components: assumptions, factors and a mathematical function, usually high order exponential or logarithmic used to relate factors to reliability. Software reliability models are used to forecast the curve of failure rate by statistical evidence available during testing phase. They also can indicate about the extra time required to carry out the test procedure in order to meet the specifications and deliver desired functionality with minimum number of defects. Therefore there are challenges whether, autonomous or machine learning techniques like other predictive methods could be able to forecast the reliability measures for a specific software application. This chapter contemplates reliability issue through a generic Machine Learning paradigm while referring the most common aspects of Support Vector Machine scenario. Couples of customized simulation and experimental results have been presented to support the proposed reliability measures and strategies.}

To choose right software testing method(s), industry needs to have an exact objective knowledge of their effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability conditions. The most common way to evaluate testing methods, for such knowledge, is with empirical studies. Reliable and comprehensive evidence can be obtained by aggregating the results of different empirical studies (family of experiments) taking into account their findings and limitations. We conducted a study to investigate the current state of the art of empirical knowledge base of three testing methods. We found that although the empirical studies conducted so far to evaluate testing methods contain many important and interesting results; however, we still lack factual and generalizable knowledge about performance and applicability conditions of testing methods(s), making it unfeasible to be readily adopted by the industry. Moreover, we tried to identify the major factors responsible for limiting academia from producing significantly reliable results having an industrial impact. We believe that besides effective and long-term academia-industry collaboration, there is a need for more systematic, quantifiable and comprehensive empirical studies (which provides scope for aggregation using rigorous techniques), mainly replications so as to create an effective and applicable knowledge base about testing methods which potentially can fill the gap between academia and industry.}

However, the lack of practitioners' involvement in the design, execution, and reporting of these methods indicates a lack of appreciation for knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners. Within EBSE, the main reason for conducting these systematic studies is to answer the practitioner's questions and impact practice. However, in many cases, academics have undertaken these studies without any direct involvement of practitioners.This report focuses on the rapid review guidelines and presents practical advice on conducting these with practitioner involvement to facilitate knowledge co-creation.Based on a literature review of rapid reviews and stakeholders engagement in medicine and our experience of using secondary studies in software engineering, we propose extensions to an existing proposal for rapid reviews in software engineering to increase researchers-practitioners knowledge exchange. We refer to the extended method as an interactive rapid review.An interactive rapid review is a streamlined approach to conduct agile literature reviews in close collaboration between researchers and practitioners in software engineering. This report describes the process and discusses possible usage scenarios and some reflections from the proposal's ongoing evaluation.The proposed guidelines will potentially boost knowledge co-creation through active researcher-practitioner interaction by streamlining practitioners' involvement and recognizing the need for an agile process.},

It is quite challenging for large-scale complex products, especially integrated products, to endure and withstand the competition after a new version release in its market domain. Unlike regular software, integrated software products require detailed exploration on the spread and impact of a defect to improve overall product quality. In this paper, we use heuristic approaches like generalized defect dependency approach, control flow graph based approach, and feature correlation based approach to study the widespread of defects in large software and suggest a metric called defect dependency metric to study the dependency of defects. We implemented the generalized defect dependency approach on an industry dataset and gathered noteworthy results. We provide a comparative a study of the heuristic approaches and comprehended their individual usage with observations. We further discuss the need of adoption of such vision in industries as a standard testing practice to improve quality.}

Therefore, in this paper, we decided to study the needs of the managers of a software development company in order to identify their team's skills. We carried out a focus group. We have interviewed 11 managers from a development company (with approximately 75 developers). As result we have mapped 5 issues, 4 possible applications and another 7 needs to create a new methodology for identifying skills. Finally, we conclude that managers are interested in a methodology to identify skills in business flow.}

However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. It seems that the two ?camps? show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations. Objective: To identify (a) the challenges to avoid risks to the collaboration by being aware of the challenges, (b) the best practices to provide an inventory of practices (patterns) allowing for an informed choice of practices to use when planning and conducting collaborative projects. Method: A systematic review has been conducted. Synthesis has been done using grounded-theory based coding procedures. Results: Through thematic analysis we identified 10 challenge themes and 17 best practice themes. A key outcome was the inventory of best practices, the most common ones recommended in different contexts were to hold regular workshops and seminars with industry, assure continuous learning from industry and academic sides, ensure management engagement, the need for a champion, basing research on real-world problems, showing explicit benefits to the industry partner, be agile during the collaboration, and the co-location of the researcher on the industry side. Conclusion: Given the importance of industry-academia collaboration to conduct research of high practical relevance we provide a synthesis of challenges and best practices, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions on how to structure their collaborations.}

The method is based on the robustness model which has been developed in collaboration between seven companies and a university. The purpose of the method is to support the companies to optimize the value obtained from the measurement programs and their cost. We evaluated the method at the seven companies and the results from applying the method to each company quantified the robustness of their programs, reflecting the real-world status of the programs and pinpointed strengths and improvements of the programs.}

However, little is known about the real value and risks associated with SRAs in industrial practice. Objective To investigate the current industrial practice of SRAs in a single company from the perspective of different stakeholders. Method An exploratory case study that investigates the benefits and drawbacks perceived by relevant stakeholders in nine SRAs designed by a multinational software consulting company. Results The study shows the perceptions of different stakeholders regarding the benefits and drawbacks of SRAs (e.g., both SRA designers and users agree that they benefit from reduced development costs; on the contrary, only application builders strongly highlighted the extra learning curve as a drawback associated with mastering SRAs). Furthermore, some of the SRA benefits and drawbacks commonly highlighted in the literature were remarkably not mentioned as a benefit of SRAs (e.g., the use of best practices). Likewise, other aspects arose that are not usually discussed in the literature, such as higher time-to-market for applications when their dependencies on the SRA are managed inappropriately. Conclusions This study aims to help practitioners and researchers to better understand real SRAs projects and the contexts where these benefits and drawbacks appeared, as well as some SRA improvement strategies. This would contribute to strengthening the evidence regarding SRAs and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about the expected SRA benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, we make available the instruments used in this study and the anonymized data gathered to motivate others to provide similar evidence to help mature SRA research and practice.}

This paper shows ways in which core principles of the project management approach, Agile, and the Scrum framework have been applied and have led to the success of three IARCs. In addition to IARCs? common challenges, these case studies represented additional challenges as they were short-term software development projects accomplished by small geographically distributed teams. A report of the demographic, collaboration setting, and challenges, along with the lessons learned from the application of Agile and Scrum in these case studies will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of IARCs. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, five Agile/Scrum aspects for each project are assessed: product ownership, release, sprint, team, and technical health. Findings indicate several success factors directly linked to the application of the Agile principles and the Scrum framework. Specifically, early and frequent customer-centric software delivery, constant communications, responsiveness to change, and highly motivated individuals were key in terms of realizing the positive outcomes in spite of the obstacles inherent to IARCs. Cautions to this approach when applied in IARCs are reported along with solutions.}

A culmination of these sources requires an organizational effort. This article presents a detailed account of a research-based innovation centre, Certus, to facilitate such a culmination for software engineering researchers. Certus has established a body of knowledge, methods and tools for the validation and verification of software systems in the Norwegian private and public sector. Certus works in close cooperation with five founding user partners and is hosted by the Simula Research Laboratory. We present the organizational structure of Certus and describe how Certus?s life and health is planned and evaluated on a regular basis as a research-based innovation centre. We expound two successful collaborations, with (a) the private sector entity Cisco systems, Norway and (b) the public sector entity the Norwegian Customs and Excise.

Objective: To shed light on industry's challenges in software testing, we characterize and synthesize the challenges reported by practitioners. Such concrete challenges can then be used for a variety of purposes, eg, research collaborations between industry and academia. Method: Our empirical research method is opinion survey. By designing an online survey, we solicited practitioners' opinions about their challenges in different testing activities. Our dataset includes data from 72 practitioners from eight different countries. Results:  Our results show that test management and test automation are considered the most challenging among all testing activities by practitioners. Our results also include a set of 104 concrete challenges in software testing that may need further investigations by the research community. Conclusion: We conclude that the focal points of industrial work and academic research in software testing differ. Furthermore, the paper at hand provides valuable insights concerning practitioners' ?pain? points and, thus, provides researchers with a source of important research topics of high practical relevance.}

Research-industry collaborations are considered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties as well as to validate the applicability of scientific results. However, research co-operations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners in the context of a study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the participating companies had undertaken two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse. However, both attempts did not succeed as expected. In our study, we identified tacit assumptions that were related to the encountered difficulties and present the lessons learned from the adoption approach. Furthermore, we report strategies that helped us to overcome the scepticism caused by a previous unsuccessful guided collaboration.}

To address this gap, diverse stakeholders are collaborating to build effective research data management [RDM] solutions for institutional research output [publications and data] that benefit researchers, institutions, and developers. This paper illustrates a university-industry collaboration between a private U.S. university (Drexel University) and a global commercial vendor (Ex Libris, a ProQuest company). The authors examine how an emerging technology infrastructure for Research Data Management will enable librarians to help institutions adopt the FAIR principles at scale. They highlight an approach for collaborative product development that aims not to change researcher habits or add to librarians? workloads. Their first year working together confirms factors recognized as contributing to successful collaborations, such as aligning goals, building understanding of each other?s organizations, and sustaining honest engagement. Though FAIR offers a simple articulation to help build campus infrastructure and change culture, its implementation will vary between different groups of researchers. Libraries and technology providers have a mutual interest in collaborating to address RDM challenges, but must recognize that collaboration takes time, perseverance, and flexibility to effect change. Librarians, researchers, and administrators from such campus offices as Research, Compliance, IT, Legal, and Graduate Studies will benefit from key lessons raised by this case study.}

Agile development, continuous integration and testing are commonly used quality assurance techniques applied in industry. Increasing the level of test automation is a key ingredient to address the short release cycles. Testing at the graphical user interface (GUI) level is challenging to automate, and therefore many companies still do this manually. To help find solutions for better GUI test automation, academics are researching scriptless GUI testing to complement the script-based approach. In order to better match industrial problems with academic results, more academia-industry collaborations for case-based evaluations are needed. This paper describes such an initiative to improve, transfer and integrate an academic scriptless GUI testing tool TESTAR into the CI pipeline of a Spanish company Prodevelop. The paper describes the steps taken, the outcome, the challenges, and some lessons learned for successful industry-academia collaboration.}

Such collaboration succeeds only if both parties are contributing and are fully committed to a mutual end. Differing models of collaboration have evolved in the UK and internationally but the current focus on Degree Apprenticeships in the UK has caused there to be much greater prominence of the issues around industry- academia interaction. Degree apprenticeships were part of an initiative introduced by the UK government in 2015 aimed at boosting employer investment in education and training. In April 2017, employers whose pay bill exceeded £3m had a 0.5% levy deducted, which was ring-fenced to support new apprentices. The degree apprentices were to be enrolled onto higher education programmes that were associated with standards and assessment plans designed by employer ?trailblazer? groups. The apprentices, who were at degree level, consequently studied as a part time students over a period of upto five years. The apprenticeships are completed when the end point assessment, which is undertaken by the relevant professional body, is successfully passed. This paper explores the extent of disruption this initiative has had to a UK university?s department of the built environment that piloted quantity surveying degree apprenticeships in Jan 16. Data were collected from a survey designed to investigate employer?s expectations of degree apprenticeships, their advantages and disadvantages and to ascertain the impact that the new approach might impact graduate recruitment in future. The survey findings were used to inform the strategic direction of the university?s engagement with industry and with the degree apprenticeship initiative.}

Of- ten rapid and immature feature deliveries over long period of time gradually de- crease the product quality, and therefore the refactoring activities become costly and effort-intensive. This situation is described by the concept of ?technical debt?, which represents the accumulated rework that organization has to do in order to prevent the slowdown of the development. In this paper we report re- sults of a case study at Ericsson on using software metrics for moving towards proactive management of technical debt. Our observations show that there are four distinguishable maturity phases of quality management over the eight years of development time of two large products: Start-n-stop, Reactive, Systematic, and Proactive quality management. Three sophisticated metrics are applied to help the organizations to move towards Proactive management of technical debt. These metrics are used on a systematic basis to provide information on the areas of the product that have tendency of accumulating technical debt. Soft- ware engineers use this information for making decisions on whether or not the pinpointed areas should be refactored.}

	abstract     = {ABSTRACTTo advance knowledge about evolution of practices within a software organisation, we offer a retrospective reflection based on several years of research into a software unit at Ericsson AB. Covering 16 years of evolution, we developed multiple publications from continuously expanding sources of software technology implementation data. While these publications report from specific junctures of software practice evolution at the unit, our retrospective reflection allows us to consider the impacts of the unitâs investments into two technology paradigms over the sixteen-year period: first into CMM-RUP with a focus on discipline and structured practices and years later into Agile-Lean with a focus on flexibility and responsive practices. Hence, we adopt retrospective reflection to investigate how imprints from the two paradigms, despite considerable timespan between the related technology implementations, eventually complemented each other in the unitâs software practices. Because one paradigm focuses on discipline and structured practices and the other on flexibility and responsive practices, our retrospective reflections consider how the two paradigms together impacted the software unitâs ambidextrous capability. As a result, we advance the idea that as software organisations over time invest in complementary technology paradigms they leave important technology traces with sustainable impacts on their software practices.}

This approach aims at following the optimal way to the goals set by the State and the university for these studies - young students, immediate continuation after MSc graduation, with membership in the university's PhD programme ensuring progress. We call these students ?administrative optimal? PhDs. However, universities also have a number of postgraduate students that work in industry. These students work full time, have significant and useful experience from practice, but have more limited resources to use for PhD-related activities. This paper reports on the challenges related to PhD students working in industry based on experiences from the field of ICT; the root cause of which is the missing support provided by the university, which focuses on ?administrative optimal? students in their PhD programmes. The paper focuses on ICT field, because it is our experience base. We believe that in ICT area it is more common to work simultaneously to studies. This fits especially in MSc studies in Finland, but the same tradition continues even in PhD level. The studies of industrial students typically need twice the time and encounter a variety of problems having their roots in the mental, practical and motivational side. We list the challenges and handle them in a structured way in the form of anti-patterns. To provide a context for our findings we have included a discussion related to general aspects of PhD studies in the paper. The aim of the paper is to open up the discussion about this important topic and report our summarised ?close to one hundred years? of experience in mentoring and supervising PhD students.}

Metrics teams can comprise several roles, and their set-up can differ between companies, as can the metrics maturity of host organizations. These differences impact the effectiveness and quality of a teamâs measurement program. Objective: Our objective was to design and evaluate a model to describe the characteristics of a mature metrics team, which efficiently designs, develops, maintains, and evolves its organizationâs measurement program. Method: We conducted an action research study on four metrics teams of four distinct companies. We designed and evaluated a domain-specific model for assessing the maturity of metrics teams â MeTeaM â and also assessed the four metrics teams per se. Results: Our results were two-fold: the creation of the metrics team maturity model MeTeaM and a template to assess metrics teams. Our evaluation showed that the model captures the characteristics of successful metrics teams and quantifies the maturity status of both the metrics teams and their host organizations. Conclusions: More mature metrics teams score higher in the MeTeaM model than less mature teams. The assessment provides less mature metrics teams with valuable insights on what factors to improve. Such insights can be shared with and acted upon successfully with their organizations.}

In this paper, we address the problem of how to establish a collaboration where software engineering and medicine meets to design robust machine learning systems to be used in patient care. We describe how we designed software systems for monitoring patients under carotid endarterectomy, in particular focusing on the process of knowledge building in the research team. Our results show what to consider when setting up such a collaboration, how it develops over time and what kind of systems can be constructed based on it. We conclude that the main challenge is to find a good research team, where different competences are committed to a common goal.}

The purpose of this work is to base the changes made so far in the academic discipline of Software Engineering taught in DECOM / UFOP, to analyze them and, if necessary, to reconstruct them. To this end, new means were created to engage students in classrooms, making them responsible fortheir own learning. A new set of didactic materials were developed from different Learning Objects and case studies specially designed for this purpose. So, these resources were used in classrooms and teachers and students opinion?s were collected along with the academic indicators (of approval, retention, escape and locking) to evaluate the impacts of the applied changes. In this way, it is expected that the continuousimprovement of the academic discipline reflects on the formation of better professionals, overcoming the distance between the students? skills and the demands of the market}

	abstract     = {In the disruptive scenario of Industry 4.0, it is essential to align universities and companies as agents in the transformations of society. A considerable portion of the results of academic research does not find application, because there is a gap between the production of university research and the market needs. Thus, as a way to better understand this connection, this study aims to verify, in the scientific literature, key success factors for co-work between universities and companies in the context of industry 4.0. From the methodological point of view, this research has a descriptive purpose with a qualitative approach, making use of secondary sources through bibliographic survey, with consultation of the Scopus database. From a sample of 80 publications, different forms of interaction between universities and companies were verified, and different factors relevant to this relationship were found. It is concluded that the relations between organizations may differ under different aspects, such as purpose and location, and although the key factors are sometimes similar, given the different contextualizations of the aspects of collaboration, it is necessary to analyze the idiosyncrasies inherent to the object intended to be analyzed, being the actions especially, but not only, related to technology transfer.}

Furthermore, research is sometimes critically reviewed for characteristics inherent to the methods. We adopt a taxonomy from the social sciences, termed here the ABC framework for SE research, which offers a holistic view of eight archetypal research strategies. ABC refers to the research goal that strives for generalizability over Actors (A) and precise measurement of their Behavior (B), in a realistic Context (C). The ABC framework uses two dimensions widely considered to be key in research design: the level of obtrusiveness of the research and the generalizability of research findings. We discuss metaphors for each strategy and their inherent limitations and potential strengths. We illustrate these research strategies in two key SE domains, global software engineering and requirements engineering, and apply the framework on a sample of 75 articles. Finally, we discuss six ways in which the framework can advance SE research.},

Supposedly, some of this variance in difficulty is particular, stemming from properties of individual contexts (the industrial partners and their work), while the rest is repeatable, related to properties of the research question and research design. Question: What are these recurring difficulty factors that arise from research question and research design? What mechanisms produce their influence? Method: We use ideation and knowledge extraction from research experience to identify potential difficulty factors, use expert discussion to understand their mechanisms, and use concept analysis to arrange them into a taxonomy. We evaluate the result by comparatively applying it to two research efforts pursued by the same research group. Results: We find six scope factors, five problematic intervention effects factors, and seven helpful intervention (side-)effects factors. Conclusion: Considering these factors systematically during the formulation of a research question and the design of a research method can help with balancing data collection difficulty with results validity and relevance.}

Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.}

It is critical to consider the unintended impact technology can have on human operators particularly regarding information flow and interactions within teams. Previous research revealed that the co-location of operator's dependent on each other for task relevant information can optimise information flow previously constrained by engineering considerations. The current work compared a novel circular configuration to that of a contemporary submarine control room. In the circular configuration, consoles faced inwards, permitting eye contact between operators, and three large screen displays were introduced to provide all operators with the same information. Ten teams participated in low and high demand dived tracking scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. All communications between operators were recorded in order to generate social, information, and task networks. These were statistically compared to networks generated from a baseline study of contemporary operation. Overall, the volume of verbal communications significantly reduced, information exchange was more structured, and the volume of tasks completed by operators significantly increased when operating in an inward facing circle configuration. The current work provides support for a data driven evidence-based approach to design that is information centric but endorsed by the end user to optimise performance and increase productivity. Implications of the work and future research ideas are discussed.}

This paper?s research agenda focuses on software engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary boundaries. We believe that with this research agenda we cover a wide spectrum of the software startup industry current needs.}

The objective of this paper is to formulate a theory of software engineering. The theory is generated from empirical observations of industry practice, including several case studies and many years of experience in working closely between academia and industry. The theory captures the balancing of three different intellectual capitals: human, social and organizational capitals, respectively. The theory is formulated using a method for building theories in software engineering. It results in a theory where the relationships between the three different intellectual capitals are explored and explained. The theory is illustrated based on an industrial case study, where it is shown how decisions made in industry practice are explainable with the formulated theory, and the consequences of the decisions are made explicit. Based on the positive results, it is concluded that the theory may have a good explanatory power, although more evaluations are needed.}

A lack of REST alignment can not only lead to wasted effort but also to defective software. However, before a company can improve the mechanisms of coordination they need to be understood first. With REST-bench we aim at providing an assessment tool that illustrates the coordination in software development projects and identify concrete improvement opportunities. We have developed REST-bench on the sound fundamentals of a taxonomy on REST alignment methods and validated the method in five case studies. Following the principles of technical action research, we collaborated with five companies, applying REST-bench and iteratively improving the method based on the lessons we learned. We applied REST-bench both in Agile and plan-driven environments, in projects lasting from weeks to years, and staffed as large as 1000 employees. The improvement opportunities we identified and the feedback we received indicate that the assessment was effective and efficient. Furthermore, participants confirmed that their understanding on the coordination between RE and ST improved.}

However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations (IAC) in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. Selecting the right topic for a new IAC has been reported to be challenging and often a deal-maker or-breaker for the start of IACs. Motivated by the above need, the goal of this paper is to propose experience-based guidelines from our 10+ software testing IACs in the past several years in Canada and Turkey to effectively and efficiently select right topics for IACs in software testing (also easily generalizable to other areas of SE), for the benefit of SE researchers and practitioners in starting new IACs. The experience and evidence supporting the guidelines in this paper are drawn from the authors' past projects and also seven on-going software-testing projects in the context of a large Turkish software and systems company. The topic-selection process has involved interaction with company representatives in the form of both multiple group discussions and separate face-to-face meetings while utilizing grounded-theory to find (converge to) topics which would be 'interesting' and useful from both industrial and academic perspectives. To increase the success of our topic selection process, we also utilized two other sources of information from the literature: (1) a set of four fitness criteria for topic selection in industry experiments, and (2) challenges and best practices for IAC, specific to project inception, as synthesized in a recent systematic literature review. We believe the results of this paper would be helpful for other researchers and practitioners not only in software testing but also in software engineering in general in increasing their chances of success in project inception and topic selection phase.}

Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating.

We included all full technical research papers published at major software architecture conferences between 1999 and 2015. Results: 17% of papers report empirical work. The number of empirical studies in software architecture has started to increase in 2005. Looking at the number of papers, empirical studies are about equally frequently used to a) evaluate newly proposed approaches and b) to explore and describe phenomena to better understand software architecture practice. Case studies and experiments are the most frequently used empirical methods. Almost half of empirical studies involve human participants. The majority of these studies involve professionals rather than students. Conclusions: Our findings are meant to stimulate researchers in the community to think about their expectations and standards of empirical research. Our results indicate that software architecture has become a more mature domain with regards to applying empirical research. However, we also found issues in research practices that could be improved (e.g., when describing study objectives and acknowledging limitations).}

	abstract     = {Software engineering (SE) research should be relevant to industrial practice. There have been regular discussions in the SE community on this issue since the 1980?s, led by pioneers such as Robert Glass. As we recently passed the milestone of ?50 years of software engineering?, some recent positive efforts have been made in this direction, e.g., establishing ?industrial? tracks in several SE conferences. However, many researchers and practitioners believe that we, as a community, are still struggling with research relevance and utility. The goal of this paper is to synthesize the evidence and experience-based opinions shared on this topic so far in the SE community, and to encourage the community to further reflect and act on the research relevance. For this purpose, we have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review (MLR) of 54 systematically-selected sources (papers and non peer-reviewed articles). Instead of relying on and considering the individual opinions on research relevance, mentioned in each of the sources, the MLR aims to synthesize and provide the ?holistic? view on the topic. The highlights of our MLR findings are as follows. The top three root causes of low relevance, discussed in the community, are: (1) Researchers having simplistic views (or wrong assumptions) about SE in practice; (2) Lack of connection with industry; and (3) Wrong identification of research problems. The top three suggestions for improving research relevance are: (1) Using appropriate research approaches such as action-research; (2) Choosing relevant (practical) research problems; and (3) Collaborating with industry. By synthesizing all the discussions on this important topic so far, this paper aims to encourage further discussions and actions in the community to increase our collective efforts to improve the research relevance. Furthermore, we raise the need for empirically-grounded and rigorous studies on the relevance problem in SE research, as carried out in other fields such as management science.}

In previous work, a mapping study was conducted to identify approaches concerning software testing techniques selection, highlighting the attributes used to support the testing technique selection process. Objective: This paper presents a unified catalog composed of testing technique selection attributes, built from the mapping study results. The aim is to assist testing practitioners to choose the best testing techniques to apply to a particular software project. Method: Through the 10 studies that present the attributes used for supporting the process of selecting software testing techniques, 178 attributes were extracted. From this, a careful analysis was conducted to exclude the attributes that appeared duplicated. Results: According to the objective and features, the catalog of attributes was classified into 8 categories, namely (i) general testing characteristics; (ii) tools; (iii) test team; (iv) software project; (v) orthogonal defect classification (ODC) faults; (vi) web applications; (vii) concurrent software; and (viii) model-based testing. Conclusion: Through the development of this catalog, we intend to help testers, guiding them on how to select the best testing technique to be applied to software projects in the industry. It is expected that this work can foster collaboration between industry and academia to help improve the quality of software developed by choosing the best testing technique. Also, we want to further extend this work through the validation in industry real cases.}

However, the rapid growth of social media has accelerated the creation and circulation of such information and turned it into a potential threat to the main societal institutions such as peace and democracy. Although many of iconic figures, policymakers, business leaders and researchers have warned us of serious repercussions of misinformation, a clear course of action is not yet visible. To tackle such an issue, the preliminary step would be the evaluation of the as-is situation, which allows us to identify the deficiencies of existing solutions. This issue has been addressed in this study by a comprehensive analysis over decades of societal efforts against misinformation. In this analysis, quelling strategies from organisational and government perspectives are explained. Then they are investigated from efficacy level and governance mode. Our analyses show that, despite a seemingly suitable setting for confronting misinformation, there is a major shortcoming in governance mode of current quelling strategies.},

Notably, China hasdominated in recent years (e.g., increased patent filings by 24 percent in 2012, compared to only7.8 percent in the US; World Intellectual Property Organization, 2013). One solution is toincrease understanding about the best way to manage innovation efforts. To that end, we offer atheoretical framework, Organized Innovation, which is based on our decade-long qualitative andquantitative research on National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Centers(ERCs). The framework is focused on what research leaders can do to create organizationalconditions ripe for innovation success. We organize our prescriptions into three pillars:Channeled Curiosity, Boundary-Breaking Collaboration, and Orchestrated Commercialization.We highlight five principles for achieving Channeled Curiosity: lead with vision, planstrategically, pursue technology platforms, synthesize solutions, and persist. Six principles mayhelp leaders implement Boundary-Breaking Collaboration: lead through persuasion and trust,create interdependence, promote collaboration across disciplines, connect with industry, linkuniversities, and seek active dialogue with government representatives. Finally, just as strategyimplementation is notoriously difficult and often poorly executed, commercialization can be adifficult process (Ramanujam et al., 1986). We propose six principles to help leaders betterOrchestrate Commercialization: coordinate the network, elevate role models, revisit incentives,appoint an industrial liaison officer, improve technology transfer execution, and bring inentrepreneurial and business expertise. By implementing these evidence-based managementpractices, we suggest that leaders can orient basic research toward developing ambitioustechnology platforms that can have practical application, foster collaboration spanning traditionalsilos, and facilitate a smooth commercialization process that includes all relevant players. Our Organized Innovation 2 results show building an organizational culture around these principles can have a dramaticimpact on technology transfer outputs. We also propose seven questions for future research toencourage further work in this important area.}

The professionals rated a number of specialized KSAs along two dimensions: how important the KSA was to their job and how difficult the KSA was to learn. Overall, communication and other non-technical skills were rated as being very important for all cyber defense jobs. Findings indicated that, for some specialty areas, technical knowledge and skills vary considerably between jobs and so the ability to teach oneself is more valuable than proficiency in any one KSA. Findings may be used to inform the development of general cybersecurity curricula, as well as curricula that focus on Cyber Network Defense Analysis, Cyber Network Defense Infrastructure Support, or Vulnerability Assessment and Management.},

This situation has driven government policy level support for transformational change initiatives, such as value-based health care (VBHC), through closer alignment and collaboration across the health-care system-life science sector nexus. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the necessary antecedents to collaboration in VBHC through a critical exploration of the existing literature, with a view to establishing the foundations for further development of policy, practice and theory in this field. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted via searches on Scopus and Google Scholar between 2009 and 2019 for peer-reviewed articles containing keywords and phrases ?Value-based healthcare industry? and ?healthcare industry collaboration?. Refinement of the results led to the identification of ?guiding conditions? (GCs) for collaboration in VBHC. Findings Five literature-derived GCs were identified as necessary for the successful implementation of initiatives such as VBHC through system-sector collaboration. These are: a multi-disciplinarity; use of appropriate technological infrastructure; capturing meaningful metrics; understanding the total cycle-of-care; and financial flexibility. This paper outlines research opportunities to empirically test the relevance of the five GCs with regard to improving system-sector collaboration on VBHC. Originality/value This paper has developed a practical and constructive framework that has the potential to inform both policy and further theoretical development on collaboration in VBHC.}

Such partnerships can be termed as ?data collaboratives?. While experimentation grows, little is known about how such collaborations are formed and implemented. In this paper, we investigate the factors which are influential and contribute to a successful data collaborative using the Critical Success Factor (CSF) approach. As a result, we propose (1) a framework of CSFs which provides a holistic view of elements coming into play when a data collaborative is formed and (2) a list of Top 15 factors which highlights the elements which typically have a greater influence over the success of the partnership. We validated our findings in two case studies and discussed three broad factors which were found to be critical for the formation of data collaboratives: value proposition, trust, and public pressure.

The results are outlined after exploring the answers to this question. For this purpose, at least 112 computer sciences graduated and post graduated personnel from different IT sectors and academia of Pakistan were surveyed using convenient sampling procedure to study the importance of their FYPs in the industry and a web based platform is suggested to bridge the gap between Industry and Academia of Pakistan. Indeed, accomplishing all of these tasks will help IT industry to get well-structured projects and students who are pre exposed to IT practices. Consequently, the linkage between industry and academia will be developed through joint and integrated research programs, offering apprenticeship to the students, industry expert opinion in curriculum designing, and appointing faculty members with sound knowledge of the industry.},

The engineering research aspect of the project aims to compare and analyze the effects of string inverts, DC optimizers, and micro-inverters on solar panel power generation under various operating conditions with the goal of optimizing both energy production and system economics. The opportunities, challenges, and expectations involved in building a collaborative working partnership between the technical college, university, and local industry are presented. Furthermore, methods for creating a successful working relationship between undergraduate students bridging two different disciplines (clean energy and electrical engineering) are discussed. The motivation for this project stems from the pervasive expansion of renewable energy resources and development of new and innovative technologies allowing for increased efficiency, decreased development costs, improved reliability and overall system simplification. When installing solar panel systems, it is essential to determine the optimal inverter topology so that maximum power can be extracted. Outside of the solar panels themselves, the inverters are the most important constituent of the solar power system as they take the DC electrical power that the solar panels produce and converts it into AC power before injecting it onto the grid. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of solar panel arrays fitted with string inverters, DC power optimizers, and micro-inverters. Together students from both institutions spent twelve months studying, installing, and analyzing the various inverter technologies. The result of this work is mutually beneficial to all parties involved. The university students gain practical, hands-on experience setting up and installing solar panels in the field while the students from the technical college benefit through learning about the theory behind the operation of the power electronic circuits. The faculty develop working relationships with industry experts and visa versa. This partnership advances academic and technical knowledge of all participants. The data gathered from this study is an immense asset for the engineers from industry as it helps them improve solar panel design and better understand customer needs. This hands-on field experience not only stimulate students? interest in learning both electronics and clean energy, but also help them recognize the importance and utility of interdisciplinary work. Moreover, the team-oriented nature of this project will foster students? development of essential skills in team-work, communication, and time-management, serving them well into their professional careers.}

Cooperation between the industry and the scientific community if done with proper design and management can turn out to be beneficial for both industry partners and academic institutions. Such a cooperation can be achieved on micro and macro levels and can provide an inclusion of various educational institutions and industry partners. The collaboration may have different goals catering to the needs of industry partners and academic institutions. The involvement of industry and academia may not only be restricted to course curriculum but also result in joint research efforts and programs, which aims to connect students and industry professionals. This paper is an attempt to explore the relationship between academic and industry cooperation in order to enhance the skill set of a student along with his or hers employability opportunities. We discuss how capital investment and technology transfer can result in better development of the society and result in creation of new products, services and employment opportunities. The paper would be listing down some of the initiatives taken by the Indian government for creating an ecosystem for university-industry collaboration. Apart from this, we list some of the prominent university-industry collaborations that have taken place in the field of computer science engineering. Finally, we discuss some key initiatives which if taken into consideration could enhance the prospects of a fruitful university-industry collaboration and can benefit to the society in large.}

Since a strong integration of academia and industry is often seen positive, here, we try to better understand motivations for practitioners to visit academic conferences like SPLC and the impact this has on such conferences. This analysis is based on nine systematic interviews with practitioners and researchers, who have been members of the SPLC community and other leading software engineering communities for a long time. Our preliminary results clarify the relevance and interest of practitioners and researchers to exchange knowledge and learn when attending scientific software engineering conferences such as SPLC. Yet, the results also highlight the differences between the goals of industry and academic conference participants, which often lead to inefficiencies and even barriers for constructive interaction at scientific conferences such as SPLC.

The need to study this topic was initiated by observing the growing challenges towards the role played by vocational colleges as one of the newly established TVET educational institutions in preparing their graduates with relevant skills. The purpose of this preliminary study was to explore the possibilities and limitations of collaboration between industrial companies and vocational colleges. An inductive qualitative approach was deployed in the research process. The respondents were administrators and lecturers from three vocational colleges. Interviews were conducted to identify the level of collaboration of the vocational colleges with companies and the limitations for such collaboration. Initial findings indicated that vocational colleges need to collaborate with industry and workplace for practical hands on that can be done by implementing the On-the-Job Training (OJT) and National Dual Training System (NDTS). However, process of getting approval for Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was the barrier specified by these three Vocational colleges.}

In the study of existing I-U cooperation, the relationship between industry and university has accumulated experiences and various channels of bilateral cooperation by sustaining interactions and absorbing capacity of knowledge by path dependence. However, as cooperation increases, 'I-U cooperation barrier' are inevitable, which is explained by two perspectives: 'Difference in mutual recognition' and 'Institutional barriers'. In order to induce the achievement of effective I-U cooperation, it is necessary to overcome these obstacles stemming from mutual relations, and it will be possible to maintain the relationship of continuous I-U cooperation. The researchers conducted research on companies participating in the I-U cooperation technology development project of the 'Ministry of Small and Medium Venture Business', which is a representative I-U cooperation program in Korea. This project will be promoted in the 'Small & Medium Business I-U cooperation Center', an administration-dedicated organization of the university. The researchers measure 'University administration's efforts' and 'Trust between I-U'to overcome'I-U cooperation barrier' In order to clarify the data of the research sample, a questionnaire survey of organizational units was conducted for all companies participating in the 'I-U cooperation technology development projects' of the SMEs and Startups between 2011 and 2015, and the responses of 356 organizations were drawn. The results showed that the higher the level of 'University administration's efforts' and Trust between I-U', the lower 'Difference in mutual recognition' and 'Institutional barriers'. Particularly, it showed higher explanatory power to overcome 'Institutional barriers' among obstacles. Therefore, it should be accompanied by the interest, implementation and institutional support of I-U-R subjects to raise the level of these two factors that can overcome 'I-U cooperation barrier'.}

In this study we aim to improve understanding of the software development strategies employed by startups. We performed this state-of-practice investigation using a grounded theory approach. We packaged the results in the Greenfield Startup Model (GSM), which explains the priority of startups to release the product as quickly as possible. This strategy allows startups to verify product and market fit, and to adjust the product trajectory according to early collected user feedback. The need to shorten time-to-market, by speeding up the development through low-precision engineering activities, is counterbalanced by the need to restructure the product before targeting further growth. The resulting implications of the GSM outline challenges and gaps, pointing out opportunities for future research to develop and validate engineering practices in the startup context.}

It is often claimed that the use of students as participants in experiments comes at the cost of low external validity while using professionals does not. [Objective] We believe a deeper understanding is needed on the external validity of software engineering experiments conducted with students or with professionals. We aim to gain insight about the pros and cons of using students and professionals in experiments. [Method] We performed an unconventional, focus group approach and a follow-up survey. First, during a session at ISERN 2014, 65 empirical researchers, including the seven authors, argued and discussed the use of students in experiments with an open mind. Afterwards, we revisited the topic and elicited experts? opinions to foster discussions. Then we derived 14 statements and asked the ISERN attendees excluding the authors, to provide their level of agreement with the statements. Finally, we analyzed the researchers? opinions and used the findings to further discuss the statements. [Results] Our survey results showed that, in general, the respondents disagreed with us about the drawbacks of professionals. We, on the contrary, strongly believe that no population (students, professionals, or others) can be deemed better than another in absolute terms. [Conclusion] Using students as participants remains a valid simplification of reality needed in laboratory contexts. It is an effective way to advance software engineering theories and technologies but, like any other aspect of study settings, should be carefully considered during the design, execution, interpretation, and reporting of an experiment. The key is to understand which developer population portion is being represented by the participants in an experiment. Thus, a proposal for describing experimental participants is put forward.}

We have identified existing STPI approaches and their characteristics (such as completeness of development, availability of information and assessment instruments, and domain limitations of the approaches) using a systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, two selected approaches (TPI NEXT and TMMi) are evaluated with respect to their content and assessment results in industry. As a result of this study, we have identified 18 STPI approaches and their characteristics. A detailed comparison of the content of TPI NEXT and TMMi is done. We found that many of the STPI approaches do not provide sufficient information or the approaches do not include assessment instruments. This makes it difficult to apply many approaches in industry. Greater similarities were found between TPI NEXT and TMMi and fewer differences. We conclude that numerous STPI approaches are available but not all are generally applicable for industry. One major difference between available approaches is their model representation. Even though the applied approaches generally show strong similarities, differences in the assessment results arise due to their different model representations.}

Several authors have proposed tool support for CIA, but very few tools were evaluated in industry. We present a case study on ImpRec, a recommendation System for Software Engineering (RSSE), tailored for CIA at a process automation company. ImpRec builds on assisted tracing, using information retrieval solutions and mining software repositories to recommend development artifacts, potentially impacted when resolving incoming issue reports. In contrast to the majority of tools for automated CIA, ImpRec explicitly targets development artifacts that are not source code. We evaluate ImpRec in a two-phase study. First, we measure the correctness of ImpRec's recommendations by a simulation based on 12 years' worth of issue reports in the company. Second, we assess the utility of working with ImpRec by deploying the RSSE in two development teams on different continents. The results suggest that ImpRec presents about 40 percent of the true impact among the top-10 recommendations. Furthermore, user log analysis indicates that ImpRec can support CIA in industry, and developers acknowledge the value of ImpRec in interviews. In conclusion, our findings show the potential of reusing traceability associated with developers' past activities in an RSSE.}

However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firmâs practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems.}

Rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been developed to automatically identify quality defects in natural language requirements. However, the literature is lacking empirical studies on the application of these techniques in industrial settings. Our goal is to investigate to which extent NLP can be practically applied to detect defects in the requirements documents of a railway signalling manufacturer. To address this goal, we first identified a set of typical defects classes, and, for each class, an engineer of the company implemented a set of defect-detection patterns by means of the GATE tool for text processing. After a preliminary analysis, we applied the patterns to a large set of 1866 requirements previously annotated for defects. The output of the patterns was further inspected by two domain experts to check the false positive cases. Additional discard-patterns were defined to automatically remove these cases. Finally, SREE, a tool that searches for typically ambiguous terms, was applied to the requirements. The experiments show that SREE and our patterns may play complementary roles in the detection of requirements defects. This is one of the first works in which defect detection NLP techniques are applied on a very large set of industrial requirements annotated by domain experts. We contribute with a comparison between traditional manual techniques used in industry for requirements analysis, and analysis performed with NLP. Our experience shows that several discrepancies can be observed between the two approaches. The analysis of the discrepancies offers hints to improve the capabilities of NLP techniques with company specific solutions, and suggests that also company practices need to be modified to effectively exploit NLP tools.}

	abstract     = {Context Several industries developing products on a large-scale are facing major challenges as their products are becoming more and more software-intensive. Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements. Objective In this work we present a lightweight RE framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems. Method A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews. Results The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken. Conclusion Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program.}

Workshops are an effective means for achieving such shared understanding. Stakeholders and team representatives can meet and discuss what a planned software system should be and how it should support achieving stakeholder goals. However, some important intended recipients of the requirements are often not present in such workshops: the developers. Thus, they cannot benefit from the in-depth understanding of the requirements and of the rationales for these requirements that develops during the workshops. The simple handover of a requirements specification hardly compensates the rich requirements understanding that is needed for the development of an acceptable system. To compensate the lack of presence in a requirements workshop, we propose to record that requirements workshop on video. If workshop participants agree to be recorded, a video is relatively simple to create and can capture much more aspects about requirements and rationales than a specification document. This paper presents the workshop video technique and a phenomenological evaluation of its use for requirements communication from the perspective of software developers. The results show how the technique was appreciated by observers of the video, present positive and negative feedbacks from the observers, and lead to recommendations for implementing the technique in practice.}

Data extraction is one of the main phases (activities) when conducting an SM or an SLR, whose objective is to extract required data from the primary studies and to accurately record the information researchers need to answer the questions of the SM/SLR study. Based on experience in a large number of SM/SLR studies, we and many other researchers have found the data extraction in SLRs to be time consuming and error-prone, thus raising the real need for heuristics and guidelines for effective and efficient data extraction in these studies, especially to be learnt by junior and young researchers. As a 'guideline' paper, this paper contributes a synthesized list of challenges usually faced during SLRs' data extraction phase and the corresponding solutions (guidelines). For our synthesis, we consider two data sources: (1) the pool of 16 SLR studies in which the authors have been involved in, as well as (2) a review of challenges and guidelines in the existing literature. Our experience in utilizing the presented guidelines in the near past have helped our junior colleagues to conduct data extractions more effectively and efficiently.},

Our goal is two-fold: 1) to propose a process to develop and evolve estimation checklists for agile teams, and 2) to evaluate the usefulness of the checklists in improving expert estimation processes. The use of checklists improved the accuracy of the estimates in two case companies. In particular, the underestimation bias was reduced to a large extent. For the third case, we could not perform a similar analysis, due to the unavailability of historical data. However, when checklist was used in two sprints, the estimates were quite accurate (median Balanced Relative Error (BRE) bias of -0.05). The study participants from the case companies observed several benefits of using the checklists during estimation, such as increased confidence in estimates, improved consistency due to help in recalling relevant factors, more objectivity in the process, improved understanding of the tasks being estimated, and reduced chances of missing tasks.}

Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], ?Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger?s risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions.?The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by ?Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens?[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It?s known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.? Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated & intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places.In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting.

We analyze, in the context of the studied company, how test case selection is performed and design a series of experiments evaluating the performance of different IR techniques. Each experiment provides lessons learned from implementation, execution, and results, feeding to its successor. The three experiments led to the following observations: 1) there is a lack of research on scalable parameter optimization of IR techniques for software engineering problems; 2) scaling IR techniques to industry data is challenging, in particular for latent semantic analysis; 3) the IR context poses constraints on the empirical evaluation of IR techniques, requiring more research on developing valid statistical approaches. We believe that our experiences in conducting a series of IR experiments with industry grade data are valuable for peer researchers so that they can avoid the pitfalls that we have encountered. Furthermore, we identified challenges that need to be addressed in order to bridge the gap between laboratory IR experiments and real applications of IR in the industry.}

This paper describes an approach that focuses on business value modeling and uses model-driven techniques to generate the input required by current software service identification methods, thus aligning business and software perspectives. This approach was evaluated in two parts. First, a quasi-experiment evaluates the perceived efficacy of the business perspective, and a proof-of-concept tool was built to check the feasibility of generating typical inputs needed by software service identification methods. The results show a promising approach for the alignment of business and IT perspectives.}

A model framework is developed which is structured, linked with organizational goal, incorporates both concepts and has a wider scope. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The research methodology used in this study is a combination of literature review and key informant interviews. The literature review includes both published as well as unpublished sources of literature. In case of key informant interviews, informal telephonic discussions have been carried out with the key executives of the organizations (industry, university, research institutions and government officials) who are actively engaged in technology identification, technology sourcing and technology transfer. Findings: It is evident from the study that initial technology transfer started with the passive role of transferee and gradually they started taking the leading role in the whole technology transfer process. At the beginning, technology transfer concept was almost limited to search and transfer, gradually it started focusing on transfer plan and implementation of technology transfer and in most recent time, focus is on effectiveness of technology transfer and creating spirit of innovation. But again each one of the existing models has a limited horizon and applicability. These existing models are too specific in nature whereas the practicing managers are in need of a comprehensive integrated model. The analysis of the limitations of the existing models has proved the necessity for development of an integrated model which is structured, aims to fulfill the aspiration of the organization, closely links with organizational goal and objectives, considers the barriers and issues in technology transfer process and takes care of both Qualitative and Quantitative parameters of technology transfer. Applications/Improvements: This proposed integrated model will help the practicing managers to take proactive approach and control of forthcoming issues of technology transfer, monitor the progress as well and create spirit of innovation}

Such methods aid business specialists improving the economics understanding of the business, helping both defining more efficient business strategies and better aligning the information technology systems with the business. This paper aims at describing the design of an experiment to compare two methods to specify economic values (e3value and value-driven development). Our experiment design allows predicting the acceptance of a particular method in practice, based on the effort of applying the method, the quality of the artifacts produced, and the user perceptions with regard to the quality of the method.}

The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic model that can be adapted to any organisation and institution interested in transferring knowledge and technology. To reach this purpose, a systematic review on technology transfer models was done using the methodology for systematic review, Methodi Ordinatio, using data from 1990 to 2015. Due to the great variety of models identified in the systematic review, and for better understanding those models and their purposes, a typology is also presented.}

However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) a hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality characteristics and (b) a mapping of these characteristics to the video production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15 characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived by the subjects from a developerâs the point of view. Six characteristics (video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability) correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is a sound basis for future refinements and extensions.}

Hence, the flexibility of modern GUIs enables countless usage scenarios and combinations including all kind of interactions. From the viewpoint of testing, this flexibility results in a combinatorial explosion of possible interaction sequences. It dramatically raises the required time and effort involved in GUI testing, which brings manual exploration as well as conventional regression testing approaches to its limits. Automated test generation (ATG) has been proposed as a solution to reduce the effort for manually designing test cases and to speed-up test execution cycles. In this paper we describe how we successfully harnessed a state-of-the-art ATG tool (Randoop) developed for code-based API testing to generate GUI test cases. The key is an adapter that transforms API calls to GUI events. The approach is the result of a research transfer project with the goal to apply ATG for testing of human machine interfaces used to control industrial machinery. In this project the ATG tool was used to generate unit test cases for custom GUI controls and system tests for exploring navigation scenarios. It helped to increase the test coverage and was able reveal new defects in the implementation of the GUI controls as well as in the GUI application.}

	abstract     = {The importance of efficient software testing procedures is driven by an ever increasing system complexity as well as global competition. In the particular case of manual test cases at the system integration level, where thousands of test cases may be executed before release, time must be well spent in order to test the system as completely and as efficiently as possible. Automating a subset of the manual test cases, i.e, translating the manual instructions to automatically executable code, is one way of decreasing the test effort. It is further common that test cases exhibit similarities, which can be exploited through reuse when automating a test suite. In this paper, we investigate the potential for reducing test effort by ordering the test cases before such automation, given that we can reuse already automated parts of test cases. In our analysis, we investigate several approaches for prioritization in a case study at a large Swedish vehicular manufacturer. The study analyzes the effects with respect to test effort, on four projects with a total of 3919 integration test cases constituting 35,180 test steps, written in natural language. The results show that for the four projects considered, the difference in expected manual effort between the best and the worst order found is on average 12 percentage points. The results also show that our proposed prioritization method is nearly as good as more resource demanding meta-heuristic approaches at a fraction of the computational time. Based on our results, we conclude that the order of automation is important when the set of test cases contain similar steps (instructions) that cannot be removed, but are possible to reuse. More precisely, the order is important with respect to how quickly the manual test execution effort decreases for a set of test cases that are being automated.}

That allows stakeholders to execute entire test suites and achieve exhaustive test coverage, since running all tests is often infeasible during work hours, i.e., in parallel to development activities. On the other hand, developers also need test feedback from CI servers when pushing changes, even if not all test cases are executed. In this paper we evaluate similarity-based test case selection (SBTCS) on integration-level tests executed on continuous integration pipelines of two companies. We select test cases that maximise diversity of test coverage and reduce feedback time to developers. Our results confirm existing evidence that SBTCS is a strong candidate for test optimisation, by reducing feedback time (up to 92% faster in our case studies) while achieving full test coverage using only information from test artefacts themselves.},

OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed - e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints - along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company.}

New algorithms, methods, and tools are being developed and validated on benchmark problems. In previous work, we have also implemented and evaluated Interactive Search-Based Software Testing (ISBST) tool prototypes, with a goal to successfully transfer the technique to industry. Objective: While SBST and SBSE solutions are often validated on benchmark problems, there is a need to validate them in an operational setting, and to assess their performance in practice. The present paper discusses the development and deployment of SBST tools for use in industry, and reflects on the transfer of these techniques to industry. Method: In addition to previous work discussing the development and validation of an ISBST prototype, a new version of the prototype ISBST system was evaluated in the laboratory and in industry. This evaluation is based on an industrial System under Test (SUT) and was carried out with industrial practitioners. The Technology Transfer Model is used as a framework to describe the progression of the development and evaluation of the ISBST system, as it progresses through the first five of its seven steps. Results: The paper presents a synthesis of previous work developing and evaluating the ISBST prototype, as well as presenting an evaluation, in both academia and industry, of that prototypeâs latest version. In addition to the evaluation, the paper also discusses the lessons learned from this transfer. Conclusions: This paper presents an overview of the development and deployment of the ISBST system in an industrial setting, using the framework of the Technology Transfer Model. We conclude that the ISBST system is capable of evolving useful test cases for that setting, though improvements in the means the system uses to communicate that information to the user are still required. In addition, a set of lessons learned from the project are listed and discussed. Our objective is to help other researchers that wish to validate search-based systems in industry, and provide more information about the benefits and drawbacks of these systems.}

By studying data from Turkish SMEs and using partial least squares structural equation modelling, we find that explicit knowledge sharing forms the basis of technology transfer. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that explicit knowledge sharing is strongly contingent upon formalised technical support while trust and technical support seemed to be important antecedents of tacit knowledge sharing.}

This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of university?industry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.}

Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback. Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax. Conclusions: The context provided by the model and language key may mitigate the i* symbol recognition deficit reported in previous works. However, the alternative concrete syntax required a significantly lower visual effort.}

However, most start-ups fail before realizing their potential. Poor software engineering, among other factors, could be a significant contributor to the challenges that start-ups experience. Little is known about the engineering context in start-up companies. On the surface, start-ups are characterized by uncertainty, high risk, and minimal resources. However, such a characterization isn't granular enough to support identification of specific engineering challenges and to devise start-up-specific engineering practices. The first step toward an understanding of software engineering in start-ups is the definition of a Start-Up Context Map-a taxonomy of engineering practices, environment factors, and goals influencing the engineering process. This map aims to support further research on the field and serve as an engineering decision support tool for start-ups. This article is part of a theme issue on Process Improvement.}

[Goal] We propose and evaluate a new DCA approach that uses cross-company data to support the practical application of DCA. [Method] We collected cross-company data on causes of requirements engineering problems from 74 Brazilian organizations and built a Bayesian network. Our DCA approach uses the diagnostic inference of the Bayesian network to support DCA sessions. We evaluated our approach by applying a model for technology transfer to industry and conducted three consecutive evaluations: (i) in academia, (ii) with industry representatives of the Fraunhofer Project Center at UFBA, and (iii) in an industrial case study at the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES). [Results] We received positive feedback in all three evaluations and the cross-company data was considered helpful for determining main causes. [Conclusions] Our results strengthen our confidence in that supporting DCA with cross-company data is promising and should be further investigated.}

Requirements-related hazards have been associated with many accidents and safety incidents. Requirements issues tend to be mitigated in companies with high processes maturity levels since they do their business in a systematic, consistent and proactive approach. However, requirements engineers need systematic guidance to consider safety concerns early in the development process. Goal: the paper investigates which safety practices are suitable to be used in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process for SCS and how to design a safety maturity model for this area. Method: we followed the design science methodology to propose Uni-REPM SCS, a safety module for Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model (Uni-REPM). We also conducted a static validation with two practitioners and nine academic experts to evaluate its coverage, correctness, usefulness, and applicability. Results: The module has seven main processes, fourteen sub-processes and 148 practices that form the basis of safety processes maturity. Moreover, we describe its usage through a tool. Conclusions: The validation indicates a good coverage of practices and well receptivity by the experts. Finally, the module can help companies in evaluating their current practices.}

We implement this approach using spreadsheets to support a light-weight risk assessment. Results: Our results from an initial validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further allows for disseminating our approach into practice.}

The hypothesis and three research questions are presented, which suggest a relationship between project management tools and the sustainable planning process of technology transfer. During the research, we use the case study of the Korean automobile industry as an excellent example of the technology-transfer process in global markets. A single project of technology transfer is discussed: the technology knowledge transfer from Korean headquarters to a Russian manufacturing subsidiary (Hyundai Motor Corporation). Quantitative data were collected through the open resources of the corporation; the qualitative data were analyzed through a case study and model parameter evaluation. The significant result that the combination of Gantt Charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams methods improves the planning process for technology-transfer projects was found in this survey. It is noticed that (a) it is useful to apply project-management tools for technology transferring models; (b) Gantt Charts and Critical Path Analysis flow diagrams have a sustainable impact on technology transfer projects; and (c) critical paths and operational reserves in network diagrams help to optimize the planning process for technology transfer}

The platform was evaluated in a real industrial environment. The results of this evaluation show that it can provide up-to-date architectural information for large code bases on a daily basis.

Recent studies have focused on the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g., Natural Language Processing ? NLP) to support Requirements Engineering activities. In this sense, this paper aims to describe a way to support requirements elicitation for novice requirements engineers through the use of NLP within a chatbot. The chatbot (KAOSbot) acts as a KAOS modeling assistant. To evaluate our hypotheses about perceived efficacy from the novice requirements engineers perspective, we performed a quasi-experiment concerning KAOSbot?s perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use. The results show that KAOSbot tool is a promising approach for specifying KAOS models because it was perceived as easy to use, useful, and the participants intend to use it in the future.}

The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products. Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure. Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption. Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency. Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.}

Although there are several studies dealing with Test Debt, current solutions often deal with specific types of tests (e.g., exploratory and automated tests) and do not address the whole software testing process. Aiming to fill these gaps, this work then proposes a Test Debt Catalog, called TestDCat, with subtypes of Test Debts and Technical Debt management activities. This catalog is built based on the results of an empirical study, a literature review and semi-structured interviews conducted with practitioners who perform testing activities on five projects from industry. For the TestDCat evaluation, a case study is conducted in real projects in order to identify if the catalog is user-friendly and if its use helps the Test Debt management during the execution of test activities in these software development projects.}

Therefore, we present a conceptual UX-aware model of requirements for software development practitioners. This layered model shows the interrelation between UX and functional and quality requirements. The model is developed based on current models of UX and software quality characteristics. Through the model we highlight the main differences between various requirement types in particular essentially subjective and accidentally subjective quality requirements. We also present the result of an initial validation of the model through interviews with 12 practitioners and researchers. Our results show that the model can raise practitioners? knowledge and awareness of UX in particular in relation to requirement and testing activities.

Extrapolating from a pilot project on reliable wireless communication in Boliden's Kankberg mine, we propose establishing a System-of-Systems (SoS) with LiDAR-equipped haulers and existing mapping solutions as constituent systems. SoS requirements engineering inevitably adds a political layer, as independent actors are stakeholders both on the system and SoS levels. We present four SoS scenarios representing different business models, discussing how development and operations could be distributed among Boliden and external stakeholders, e.g., the vehicle suppliers, the hauling company, and the developers of the mapping software. Based on eight key variation points, we compare the four scenarios from both technical and business perspectives. Finally, we validate our findings in a seminar with participants from the relevant stakeholders. We conclude that to determine which scenario is the most promising for Boliden, trade-offs regarding control, costs, risks, and innovation must be carefully evaluated.}

[Question/Problem:] In this paper, we deliberate the synergies between the lean mindset and DSR, and explore the application of lean development approaches in the planning and execution of software and requirements engineering research projects. [Principal idea:] The widespread adoption of lean approaches in many business and technology practices today provides the impetus to explore their application in the context of software and requirements engineering empirical research. Toward this, we offer a review of key principles underlying the lean mindset and provide an overview of the typical processes followed in DSR research projects. Subsequently, we reflect the potential for lean development approaches to facilitate DSR projects. [Contribution:] We propose a conceptual framework that integrates lean principles with DSR phases and outputs, and we aim to inspire future discussion on the application of the lean mindset in the planning and execution of empirical research projects.}

They therefore require monitoring techniques to observe systems and detect deviations from their requirements. The focus of existing monitoring approaches, however, is mainly on detecting violations of expected behavior, while support for diagnosing violations is typically limited or even neglected. Diagnosis is particularly challenging in SoS due to their technological heterogeneity and the diversity of development tools in use. Uncovering the root cause of a violation typically requires developers to trace violations to artifacts such as source code or requirements documents, which is difficult without detailed domain knowledge. In this paper we describe our experiences of developing a tool-supported approach facilitating the diagnosis of requirements violations in SoS. We describe how we complemented a requirements monitoring model with a system artifact model relating SoS artifacts needed for diagnosis with monitored events. We customized our approach to an industrial SoS and conducted a scenario-based walkthrough with engineers developing the SoS and engineers and researchers unfamiliar with it. The results of our evaluation have shown that our approach can significantly ease diagnosing violations in a real-world SoS.}

In a Safety-Critical System (SCS), requirements problems have been associated with accidents and safety incidents. Objective: This work investigates which safety practices/actions are suitable to be used in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of SCS and how to design a safety maturity model for this area. Method: we adopted different empirical techniques to propose Uni-REPM SCS, which consists of a safety module to be included in the Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model (Uni-REPM). Results: The safety module has seven main processes, 14 sub-processes and 148 safety actions describing principles and practices that form the basis of safety processes maturity. Conclusions: Preliminary validation with two practitioners and nine academic experts indicates that the safety module can help organizations to evaluate their current safety practices with respect to their RE process. Moreover, it also offers a step-wise improvement strategy to raise their safety maturity level.}

Alas, for an innovator the search for the right partners and visions can be lengthy and difficult. Even though the analysis of context and problem, the identification of stakeholders, the analysis of stakeholder goals and techno-logical capabilities, and the definition of requirements belong to the cornerstones of requirements engineering, this requirements engineering problem has hardly been explored so far. In an attempt to avoid re-invention of well-tried solutions, we discovered journalism as a discipline that, as a rich body of methodical knowledge, may act as a source for the guidance of how a requirements engineer may support the launch of innovation projects. In the role of a journalist, the requirements engineer makes partners and their capabilities visible and thereby allows the parties to identify each other and meet. The transparency that develops between the parties becomes an instrument for consortia to emerge and to eventually answer calls for innovation with appropriate visions for innovation projects. This paper introduces the problem of initiating innovation projects and describes the potential role of journalism as a metaphor for addressing the problem. The paper also describes our plans in designing an innovation journalism approach that we hope will enable requirements engineers to increase innovation potential and ease the launch of projects that bring about these innovations.}

A typical analysis includes validation of policies and the verification of the systems implementing them. One efficient way to validate policies is simulation, e.g., by simulating whether a proposed law reform would realize target objectives. Once validated, policies are implemented into public administration procedures and eGovernment applications. Systems implementing legal policies also need to be analyzed and verified, e.g., through testing, to ensure that they are compliant with the underlying policies. Currently, legal policy analysis is conducted using a combination of spreadsheets and software code. Such strategy suffers mainly from being hard to use by legal experts due to the lack of adequate background. This is partly rooted in the fact that available techniques to formalize legal policies are based on complex logical expressions and code. The main goal of this research project, that this paper describes, is to narrow the aforementioned expertise gap by proposing convenient, systematic and automated techniques to support analysis of legal polices from their design to their implementation.}

	abstract     = {Testing applications with graphical user Interfaces (GUI) is an important but also a time-consuming task in practice. Tools and frameworks for GUI test automation can make the test execution more efficient and lower the manual labor required for regression testing. However, the test scripts used for automated GUI-based testing still require a substantial development effort and are often reported as sensitive to change, leading to frequent and costly maintenance. The efficiency of development, maintenance, and evolution of such tests are thereby dependent on the readability of scripts and the ease-of-use of test tools/frameworks in which the test scripts are defined. To address these shortcomings in existing state-of-practice techniques, a novel technique referred to as Augmented Testing (AT) has been proposed. AT is defined as testing the System Under Test (SUT) through an Augmented GUI that superimposes information on top of the SUT GUI. The Augmented GUI can provide the user with hints, test data, or other support while also observing and recording the tester's interactions. For this study, a prototype tool, called Scout, has been used that adheres to the AT concept that is evaluated in an industrial empirical study. In the evaluation, quasi-experiments and questionnaire surveys are performed in two workshops, with 12 practitioners from two Swedish companies (Ericsson and Inceptive). Results show that Scout can be used to create equivalent test cases faster, with statistical significance, than creating automated scripts in two popular state-of-practice tools. The study concludes that AT has cost-value benefits, applies to industrial-grade software, and overcomes several deficiencies of state-of-practice GUI testing technologies in terms of ease-of-use.}

To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the relationship between onboarding strategies and the performance evolution of newcomers in large-scale, globally distributed projects. Furthermore, there are no approaches to support the development of strategies to systematically onboard developers. In this paper, we address these gaps by means of an industrial case study. We identified that the following aspects seem to be related to the observed onboarding results: the distance to mentors, the formal training approach used, the allocation of large and distributed tasks in the early stages of the onboarding process, and team instability. We conclude that onboarding must be planned well ahead and should consider avoiding the aspects mentioned above. Based on the results of this investigation, we propose a process to strategize and evaluate onboarding. To develop the process, we used business process modeling. We conducted a static validation of the proposed process utilizing interviews with experts. The static validation of the process indicates that it can help companies to deal with the challenges associated with the onboarding of newcomers through more systematic, effective, and repeatable onboarding strategies.}

Method: In a technology transfer project, a software analytics platform was incrementally developed between academic and industrial partners to address their software quality problems. This paper focuses on exploring the value provided by this software analytics platform in two pilot projects. Results: Practitioners emphasized major benefits including the improvement of product quality and process performance and an increased awareness of product readiness. They especially perceived the semi-automated functionality of generating quality requirements by the software analytics platform as the benefit with the highest impact and most novel value for them. Conclusions: Practitioners can benefit from modern software analytics platforms, especially if they have time to adopt such a platform carefully and integrate it into their quality assurance activities.}

In order to improve quality of outputs in crowdsourcing, it is important to assign workers to tasks they are good at. In multiclass classification tasks, which are common in crowdsourcing, sometimes different workers are good at different subcategories. It suggests that we can improve the accuracy of a multiclass classification task by reorganizing the task into a hierarchical classification task, and assigning workers to appropriate sub-tasks in the hierarchy. We experimentally show that we can actually improve the accuracy of a classification task by this approach. We collected performance data of workers in a flat multiclass classification task on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and simulated the process of the reorganization and the worker allocation. We confirmed that the output in the simulation achieves higher accuracy than that of the original flat classification task.}

Thus gaining clarity on the state-of-the-art in inner source research is challenging. In particular, there is no systematic literature review of known research to date on inner source. We address this challenge by presenting a systematic literature review that identifies, critically evaluates and integrates the findings of 29 primary studies on inner source. Case study approach is the common research approach undertaken in the area. We also identified 8 frameworks/methods, models and tools proposed in the literature to support inner source, as well as a set of benefits and challenges associated with inner source.

These simulations are then offered, as composed simulation services, to human and technical consumers. Instrumental to this, is functionality that lets a simulation operator discover and compose simulation services and execute the composition. We describe this functionality in terms of what we call MSaaS infrastructure capabilities. Following the idea of stepwise refinement, the discovery and composition of simulation services can be done at design time using implementation-independent information about simulation services and at implementation time using implementation-specific information about simulation services. The execution environment can also be set up at design time and at implementation time. We therefore describe the MSaaS infrastructure capabilities in terms of how they are used on both implementation-independent and implementation-specific service information. By doing these elaborations, we intend to gain greater insight into how to perform simulation service discovery, composition, and execution. We conclude that although much of the required functionality for a MSaaS infrastructure is available through existing platforms and frameworks, it is necessary to offer this functionality as services, alongside (composed) simulation services, to fulfill the MSaaS vision.}

The results show that, despite the diversity of models available in the literature, there is an absence of a model that considers the sphere of sustainable development, and the possible barriers and opportunities in the formulation of its stages. Based on this, a conceptual Barriers and Opportunities-based model focused on sustainable development was proposed, aiming to fill the scientific gap found, thus contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. The model has four macro steps: Plan; Enable; Implement and Evaluate, which range from identifying the technological need to documentation, registration, and feedback on implementation. As a result, the model can anticipate and address possible barriers, making use of opportunities as facilitators. Also, this research contributes to the governmental sphere, since with the use of the model it is expected that it can assist in the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals.}

Objective: This study aims to empirically investigate objectives and complexities organizations need to consider and balance between when deciding on what software to share as OSS, when to share it, and whether to create a new or contribute to an existing community. Method: A multiple-case study of three case organizations was conducted in two research cycles, with data gathered from interviews with 20 practitioners from these organizations. The data was analyzed qualitatively in an inductive and iterative coding process. Results: 12 contribution objectives and 15 contribution complexities were found. Objectives include opportunities for improving reputation, managing suppliers, managing partners and competitors, and exploiting externally available knowledge and resources. Complexities include risk of loosing control, risk of giving away competitive advantage, risk of creating negative exposure, costs of contributing, and the possibility and need to contribute to an existing or new community. Conclusions: Cross-case analysis and interview validation show that the identified objectives and complexities offer organizations a possibility to reflect on and adapt their contribution strategies based on their specific contexts and business goals.}

We evaluated Carrot using a mixed approach. we evaluated the prediction accuracy using historical data and the metrical Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).

For the platform provider, the ecosystem represents a massive business opportunity if the platform succeeds to make the collaborations among the users value-creating and to facilitate trust. While the requirements flow for evolving existing ecosystems is understood, it is unclear how to analyse an ecosystem that is to be. In this paper, we draw on recent work on collaboration modelling in requirements engineering and propose an integrated framework for the analysis of multi-party collaboration that is to be supported by a platform. Drawing on a real-world case, we describe how the framework is applied and the results that have been obtained with it. The results indicate that the framework was useful to understand the ecosystem context for a planned platform in the domain of artificial intelligence, allowed identification of platform requirements and offered a basis to plan validation.}

This approach works well when one is just seeking the adoption of a technology by a specific client, but it can not solve a common problem that is the adoption of new technologies by a large mass of potential new users. In wider context, it no longer makes sense to focus on peer to peer transfer. A new way of looking at the problem is necessary. The diffusion of innovations is more natural when it is treated as a spread of information in a community, similar to that observed in epidemics. This work proposes a paradigm shift to show that the adoption of programming languages can be formally treated as an epidemic. This shift of focus allows the dynamics of adoption of programming languages to be mathematically modeled as such, defining models that explain the communities' behavior when adopting programming languages, and allows some forecast to be made.},

For example, they often enforce strict syntax for test cases, like the ?Given-When-Then? format, which may not always be easy to write for a given test case. A new test automation framework named Gauge (gauge.org) addresses that limitation since it does not prescribe the BDD testing process with a strict syntax. In Gauge, writing a test case is as easy as writing down the flow of test cases in several itemized sentences in a natural language, like English. In the context of Testinium (testinium.com), a large software testing company which provides software testing services, tools and solutions to a large number of clients, we have actively used the Gauge framework since 2018 to develop large automated front-end test suites for several large web applications. In this paper/talk, the speakers will share several examples and best practices of developing automated tests in natural-language requirements using the Gauge framework. By learning from the ideas presented in the talk, readers (attendees) will be able to consider applying the Gauge framework in their own test automation projects.}

To support development organizations in the future, efficient ways to manage information throughout the systems' lifecycle are needed. However, there is currently a lack of methods to continuously manage artifacts for self-adaptive systems. In our research, we aim to close this gap by developing methods and techniques to manage both design-time and run-time artifacts.

Depending on the perspective, different views of importance are given to the conceptual dimensions of research quality. Objective: We aim to better understand what constitutes research quality from the perspective of the empirical software engineering community. In particular, we intend to assess the level of alignment between researchers with regard to a conceptual model of research quality. Method: We conducted a mixed methods approach comprising an internal case study and a complementary focus group. We carried out a hierarchical voting prioritization based on the conceptual model to collect relative values for importance. In the focus group, we also moderate discussions with experts to address potential misalignment. Results: We provide levels of alignment with regard to the importance of quality dimensions in the view of the participants. Moreover, the conceptual model fairly expresses the quality of research but has limitations with regards the structure and description of its components. Conclusion: Based on the results, we revised the conceptual model and provided an updated version adjusted to the context of empirical software engineering research. We also discussed how to assess quality alignment in research using our approach, and how to use the revised model of quality to characterize an assessment instrument.}

Method: A technology transfer model was used to propose a BDD based process for large-scale projects. We conducted six workshop sessions to understand the challenges and benefits of BDD. Later, an industrial evaluation was performed for the process with the help of practitioners. Results: From our investigations, understanding of a business aspect of requirements, their improved quality, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts, and help for test organization are found as benefits of BDD. Practitioners identified the following challenges: specification and ownership of behaviors, adoption of new tools, the software projectsâ scale, and versioning of behaviors. We proposed a process to address these challenges and evaluated the process with the help of practitioners. Conclusion: The evaluation proved that BDD could be adapted and used to facilitate interaction in large-scale software projects in the software industry. The feedback from the practitioners helped in improving the proposed process.}

Hence, it is necessary to select a smaller number of tests for cost reduction as well as fault detection. For a type of nonnumeric systems, the linear-order algorithm for adaptive random testing (ART) (LART) technique is proposed by making tests evenly spread in nonnumeric input domains. To further enhance LART in the industrial scenarios where the number of input categories is too large, a new technique called category selection-based ART (CSBART), in which partial categories are selected to calculate tests' distances to guide LART, is proposed in this article. The fault-coverage effectiveness of CSBART is evaluated via an empirical study on two large scale billing systems with tens of millions of test cases, and the results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed CSBART. We also find that, after category selection, CSBART can outperform a more complex and widespread n-per cluster sampling technique that uses K-means clustering to certain extents.}

Given this, this paper presents a BN for managing risks of software projects and the results of a static validation performed through a focus group with eight practitioners. As a result, the practitioners agreed that our proposed to manage technological risks of software projects using BN is valuable and easy to use. Given the successful results, we concluded that the proposed solution is promising.}

	abstract     = {Modern automotive software systems consist of hundreds of heterogeneous software applications, belonging to separated function domains and often developed within distributed automotive ecosystems consisting of original equipment manufactures, tier-1 and tier-2 companies. Hence, the development of modern automotive software systems is a formidable challenge. A well-known instrument for coping with the tremendous heterogeneity and complexity of modern automotive software systems is the use of architectural languages as a way of enabling different and specific views over these systems. However, the use of different architectural languages might come with the cost of reduced interoperability and automation as different languages might have weak to no integration. In this article, we tackle the challenge of integrating two architectural languages heavily used in the automotive domain for the design and timing analysis of automotive software systems: AMALTHEA and Rubus Component Model. The main contributions of this paper are (i) a mapping scheme for the translation of an AMALTHEA architecture into a Rubus Component Model architecture where high-precision timing analysis can be run, and the back annotation of the analysis results on the starting AMALTHEA architecture; (ii) the implementation of the proposed scheme, which uses the concept of model transformations for enabling a full-fledged automated integration; (iii) the application of such automation on three industrial automotive systems being the brake-by-wire, the full blown engine management system and the engine management system. We discuss and evaluate the proposed contributions using an online, experts survey and the above-mentioned use cases. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that the proposed automation mechanism is correct and applicable in industrial contexts. Besides, we observe that the performance of the automation mechanism does not degrade when translating large models with several thousands of elements. Eventually, we conclude that experts in this field find the proposed contribution industrially relevant.}

However, the challenge of identifying and selecting the right stakeholders and the potential of using other inanimate requirements sources for RE activities for market-driven products is not extensively addressed. Market-driven products are influenced by a large number of stakeholders. Consulting all stakeholders directly is impractical, and companies utilize indirect data sources, e.g. documents and representatives of larger groups of stakeholders. However, without a systematic approach, companies often use easy to access or hard to ignore data sources for RE activities. As a consequence, companies waste resources on collecting irrelevant data or develop the product based on the sub-optimal information sources that may lead to missing market opportunities. We propose a collaborative method to support identification and selection of the most relevant data sources for MDRE. The method consists of four steps and aims to build consensus between different perspectives in an organization and facilitates the identification of the most relevant data sources. We demonstrate the use of the method with two industrial case studies. Our results show that the method can support identification and selection of the most relevant data sources for MDRE in two ways: (1) by providing systematic steps to identify and prioritize data sources for RE, and (2) by highlighting and resolving discrepancies between different perspectives in an organization.}

As a developer, one may receive many code review requests every day, i.e., the review requests need to be prioritised. Manually prioritising review requests is a challenging and time-consuming process. To address the above problem, we conducted an industrial case study at Ericsson aiming at developing a tool called Pineapple, which uses a Bayesian Network to prioritise code review requests. To validate our approach/tool, we deployed it in a live software development project at Ericsson, wherein more than 150 developers develop a telecommunication product. We focused on evaluating the predictive performance, feasibility, and usefulness of our approach. The results indicate that Pineapple has competent predictive performance (RMSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.15). Furthermore, around 82.6% of Pineapple's users believe the tool can support code review request prioritisation by providing reliable results, and around 56.5% of the users believeit helps reducing code review lead time. As future work, we planto evaluate Pineapple's predictive performance, usefulness, and feasibility through a longitudinal investigation.}

However, there are not contributions that allow the quality evaluation specifically related to the usability and portability characteristics. Therefore, this paper presents, first, an evaluation method aligned to the ISO/IEC 25040 standard, its activities, and artifacts which will be used for the serious game's quality evaluation. This method's name is Serious Game Quality Assessment Method (SG-QUAM).. Second, it provides a usability and portability model aligned to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and oriented to this specific domain (i.e., serious digital games), and lastly, the quality in use while players are using the application. Moreover, 16 software engineers evaluated the solution through an experiment; the results showed good insights oriented to improve the contributions and concluded that SG-QUAM is perceived as easy to use, useful and that could be used in the future.}

Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firms practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems.},

Technology transfer may be accomplished in two ways: selling proprietary intellectual property to businesses or forming start-up firms. Universities, businesses, state and national economies and society as a whole prosper from successful technology transfer. Every institution, school, and university as a whole would benefit from the establishment of university industry links and a Technology Transfer Policy. It is critical to promote partnerships and strong collaboration between universities and industries that encourage realistic information development while also facilitating technology transfer. Students must be nurtured and equipped with realistic skills, which can only be accomplished by near collaboration and win-win agreements between universities and businesses in general. As a result, Ethiopia's educational system has placed a premium on university-industry linkages and technology transfer, resulting in the establishment of offices in all public universities throughout the region. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the success of technology transfer and innovation in western Oromia, Ethiopia. To determine the root cause of the issue, quality tools: Cause effect diagram and Parato diagram was used in this analysis. Mitigation techniques were designed to prevent recurrence of known poor performance areas (weaknesses), as well as a planning structure that traces the area's goals.}

In practice, a multitude of configuration management, cloud-based continuous integration, and automated deployment tools exist, and often more than one for each task. Tools are adopted (and given up) by OSS projects regularly. Prior work has shown that some tool adoptions are preceded by discussions, and that tool adoptions can result in benefits to the project. But important questions remain: how do teams decide to adopt a tool? What is discussed before the adoption and for how long? And, what team characteristics are determinant of the adoption?In this paper, we employ a large-scale empirical study in order to characterize the team discussions and to discern the teamlevel determinants of tool adoption into OSS projects' development pipelines. Guided by theories of team and individual motivations and dynamics, we perform exploratory data analyses, do deep-dive case studies, and develop regression models to learn the determinants of adoption and discussion length, and the direction of their effect on the adoption. From data of commit and comment traces of large-scale GitHub projects, our models find that prior exposure to a tool and member involvement are positively associated with the tool adoption, while longer discussions and the number of newer team members associate negatively. These results can provide guidance beyond the technical appropriateness for the timeliness of tool adoptions in diverse programmer teams.Our data and code is available at https://github.com/lkyin/tool_adoptions.},

For class size and depth there was substantially less agreement with expert advice.

	abstract     = {The optimization of processes in the software development life cycle has become mandatory, since companies need to reduce the costs of their projects and shorten the time to market without affecting the quality of the product. With regards to software products, activities related to the testing process play a major role in their quality, since they assure that the product complies with the elicited requirements. However, companies usually do not perform testing activities on software projects due to financial and time constraints. These costs may be even higher in testing processes that rely on manual execution of activities, which is error-prone and can take too much time. To mitigate this situation, test automation allows the reduction of the effort required. This paper presents an experience report in a Test Factory about the use of a tool that partially automates the specification of test procedures based on use cases. The tool aims to read the textual use cases from the requirement management system, extract the test case procedures and required inputs to manual editing, and then send the test cases to the test management system. This solution is then applied to software from the telecommunications industry. This paper also presents how the tool was used and the lessons learned during the whole process.},

The constructed process is evaluated using (i) qualitative feedback from software practitioners and (ii) a demonstration of the process in an industry setting. The process was evaluated for three constraints: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions. Results: The process consists of eleven activities that support development for reuse, development with reuse, and assessment of the costs and benefits of reuse. During the evaluation, practitioners found the process a useful method to support reuse. In the industrial demonstration, it was noted that the activities in the solution helped in developing an automated acceptance test with reuse faster than creating a test from scratch i.e., searching, assessment and adaptation parts. Conclusion: The process is found to be useful and relevant to the industry during the preliminary investigation.}

We have explored such prioritisation with an organisation consisting of several business units appearing as stakeholders that compete for the same development resources. The challenge lay in taking objective factors like the cost-benefit ratio and technical dependencies of the requests into account while creating a high level of stakeholder satisfaction with the defined release scope. Together with the organisation, we have designed and implemented a tailored method that uses the stakeholders? satisfaction as a structured means for validating the criteria-based prioritisation results. The paper extends prior work by taking the perspective of the organisational stakeholders and describing the method design from the organisation?s perspective, reports the use of the method in the organisation, and summarises the lessons learned from using the method in the organisation. The results are useful to increase the maturity of prioritisation in industrialpractice.}

Specialized literature often presents limitations on interpreting surveys? results, mainly due to the use of sampling frames established by convenience and non-probabilistic criteria for sampling from them. In this sense, we argue that a strategy to support the systematic establishment of sampling frames from an adequate source of sampling can contribute to improve this scenario. Method A conceptual framework for supporting large scale sampling in Software Engineering surveys has been organized after performing a set of experiences on designing such strategies and gathering evidence regarding their benefits. The use of this conceptual framework based on a sampling strategy developed for supporting the replication of a survey on characteristics of agility and agile practices in software processes is depicted in this paper. Result A professional social network (Linkedln) was established as the source of sampling and its groups of interest as the units for searching members to be recruited. It allowed to deal with a sampling frame composed by more than 110,000 members (prospective subjects) distributed over 19 groups of interest. Then, through the similarity levels observed among these groups, eight strata were organized and 7745 members were invited, from which 291 have confirmed participation and answered the questionnaire. Conclusion The heterogeneity and number of participants in this replication contributed to improve the strength of original survey?s results. Therefore, we believe the sharing of this experience, the instruments and plan can be helpful for those researchers and practitioners interested on executing large scale surveys in Software Engineering.}

With valid concerns of a potential decrease in student engagement, it was necessary to focus on the most effective learning strategies and reduce cognitive load. The software engineering professional practice postgraduate module at University College London uses flipped learning, providing resources prior to online discussions scheduled during normal lecture time. Questionnaires before topics establish student's level of knowledge and ensure well-understood concepts are not repeated. This allowed increased time for more challenging and engaging content. Industry guest speaker talks are integrated with academic lectures and provide alternative perspectives for each topic. Some industry speakers had less time during the current academic year to prepare videos so alternative ?fireside chats' (as occur in industry conferences) were employed to reduce speakers' preparation time. Analysis, across several measures indicates these changes to both academic and industry sessions have led to more than a 26% increase in student engagement. Whilst this required a substantial increase in workload for lecturers much of this development work can be utilized again in the future. The current module design also gives both academic and industry speakers a greater range of options in delivering their content.}

A shared understanding of the knowledge valorization process is essential for the success of such public-private partnerships. Conceptual models enable stakeholders to discuss and understand complex processes and their corresponding activities but current models are lacking granularity in terms of activities taking place. Building upon the microbiota valorization and technology transfer cycle, this review synthesizes 32 conceptual models on knowledge valorization into a Societal Impact Value Cycle that describes relevant activities. The cycle is contextualized to the microbiota industry and 8 key points for successful innovation are highlighted. The model elucidates the importance of including unmet needs in wider society for generating socioeconomic benefits. While market and society domains contained the highest number of barriers in the probiotics industry, they were scarcely covered by the reviewed literature, highlighting their underexposure. The resulting generally applicable model aids stakeholders in outlining a thorough strategy to deliver really new and radical innovations.}

The proposed framework called 4PTRB which includes people, process, product, project, technology, risk, and business management areas. The 4PTRB software project management framework provides a whole comprehensive view to help software project managers to improve their project management effectiveness. The framework is validated by conducting a web-based survey of software professional practitioners around the world. A statistical analysis of twenty software projects has been conducted as a case study thereafter, spanning small to large development projects. The consistency of the case study and survey results shows the power of the 4PTRB framework as an inclusive software project management framework.}

Many meta-modelling notations, approaches and tools have been proposed along the years, which widely vary regarding their supported modelling features. However, current approaches tend to be closed and rigid with respect to the supported concepts and semantics. Moreover, extending the environment with features beyond those natively supported requires highly technical knowledge. This situation hampers flexibility and interoperability of meta-modelling environments. In order to alleviate this situation, we propose open meta-modelling frameworks, which can be extended and configured via meta-object protocols (MOPs). Such environments offer extension points on events like element instantiation, model loading or property access, and enable selecting particular model elements over which the extensions are to be executed. We show how MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and allow describing a wide range of meta-modelling concepts. As a proof of concept, we show and compare an implementation in the MetaDepth tool and an aspect-based implementation atop the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF). We have evaluated our approach by extending EMF and MetaDepth with modelling services not foreseen initially when they were created. The evaluation shows that MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and are powerful enough to support the specification of a broad variety of meta-modelling features.}

This work explores existing research on DSL evolution to summarize, structure and analyze this area of research, and to identify trends and open issues. We conducted a systematic mapping study and identified 98 papers as potentially relevant for our study. By applying inclusion and exclusion criteria we selected a set of 34 papers relevant for DSL evolution. We classified and analyzed these papers to create a map of the research field. We conclude that DSL evolution is a topic of increasing relevancy. However, research on language evolution so far did not focus much on the characteristics DSLs exhibit. Also, there are not many cross-references between our primary studies meaning researchers are often not aware of potentially useful work. Our study results help researchers and practitioners working on DSL-based approaches to get an overview of existing research on DSL evolution and open challenges.}

However, currently not much is known about this evolution and its impact on the MDE setting?s maturity, i.e., on changeability and other productivity dimensions. Research so far focuses on evolution of separate building blocks, such as (modeling-) languages, tools, or transformation, only. In this article, we address the lack of knowledge about evolution of MDE settings by investigating case studies from different companies. The first results reveal (1) that there is evolution that affects the composition of an MDE setting (structural evolution) and has the potential to strongly impact aspects, such as changeability and (2) that this structural evolution actually occurs in practice. Based on these first results, we investigated (3) whether there are cases in practice, where structural evolution already altered the risks of changeability given by the respective MDE setting. Therefore, we search and identify examples for such evolution steps on MDE settings from practice and collected six case studies on evolution histories in detail. As a result, we show in this paper that structural evolution (a) is not seldom in practice and (b) sometimes leads to the introduction of changeability risks.}

We propose an idea of a lightweight approach, utilizing the popular tools adopted by numerous software companies, to enable such evaluation without an excessive effort. The proposal is illustrated with a pilot study, where the data from 6 industrial projects from a single organization was analyzed and 3 metrics regarding requirements quality, rework effort and testing were used to demonstrate the impact of different RE techniques applied among considered projects. We also discuss the factors important to enabling adoption of the proposed approach.}

This work studies the combination of the qualitative MoSCoW method and cluster analysis for requirements selection. The feasibility of our methodology has been tested on three case studies (with 20, 50 and 100 requirements). In each of them, the requirements have been clustered, and then the clustering configurations found have been evaluated using internal validation measures for the compactness, connectivity and separability of the clusters. The experimental results show the validity of clustering strategies for the identification of the core set of requirements for the software product, being the number of categories proposed by MoSCoW a good starting point in requirements prioritization and negotiation.}

Due to the various purposes of feature models, they can be a cross-cutting concern in an organization, integrating technical and business aspects. For this reason, various stakeholders (e.g., developers and consultants) may get involved into modeling the features of a software product line. Currently, collaboration in such a scenario can only be done with face-to-face meetings or by combining single-user feature-model editors with additional communication and version-control systems. While face-to-face meetings are often costly and impractical, using version-control systems can cause merge conflicts and inconsistency within a model, due to the different intentions of the involved stakeholders. Advanced tools that solve these problems by enabling collaborative, real-time feature modeling, analogous to Google Docs or Overleaf for text editing, are missing. In this article, we build on a previous paper and describe (1) the extended formal foundations of collaborative, real-time feature modeling, (2) our conflict resolution algorithm in more detail, (3) proofs that our formalization converges and preserves causality as well as user intentions, (4) the implementation of our prototype, and (5) the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the prototype?s usability. Our contributions provide the basis for advancing existing feature-modeling tools and practices to support collaborative feature modeling. The results of our evaluation show that our prototype is considered helpful and valuable by 17 users, also indicating potential for extending our tool and opportunities for new research directions.}

This problem is frequently tackled by organizing courses in the form of capstone projects. Unfortunately, this approach requires additional resources (e.g., more tutors, external customers, etc.) what limits the potential number of participants. As a response to this problem, we propose a Scrum-centric framework that allows combining lectures and laboratory classes with a minimalistic capstone project, all within a regular SE course. The course is organized similarly to a project run according to the Scrum guidelines. The focal point of the framework is the synchronization between the content presented during lectures and laboratory classes with the capstone project iterations (sprints). We also share our experience from 2 years of conducting Software Engineering course organized according to the framework together with the results of a cross-sectional survey assessing student perceptions of the effectiveness of the approach.}

As part of a research collaboration with ABB, we developed a decision documentation tool that aims to ensure industrial applicability. This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate the add-in, we conducted a case study with architects from ABB. In this study, we assessed to what extent and why software architects intend to use our approach. We therefore investigated the perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and contextual factors threat influence the architectâs intention to use the tool. We found that the tool has a high relevance for software architects, that it increases the quality of decision documentation and that it improves productivity of architects in various ways. With respect to ease-of-use, the study identified the need for better guidelines. With respect to contextual factors, we found several factors that influence the intention to use the add-in in an industrial environment.}

As a result, the DRR technology-sharing environment needs strengthening based on the findings of difficulties in sharing, investment, and commitment. The purpose of this paper is to three fold: first, it will clarify that a web-based platform is the best conduit for linking DRR technology from the supplier to the beneficiary developing countries. Second, it will find the most evolutionary path based on Korean case studies. Finally, it will make recommendations for the efficient implementation of a web-based platform for DRR technology sharing. Design/methodology/approach This paper posits that DRR technology sharing is a necessary part of enhancing resilience to disasters in the Asia-Pacific region. The evolution of web-based approaches (a merchandise display-type platform, a journal-type platform, an electronic market-type platform, and an architecture and governance-type platform) and an actual case of space technology sharing providing support for an evolution toward community-based technology sharing in DRR. The research will find the most efficient way going forward based on the case study of a four-year R & D project sponsored by the South Korean Government. It will also find the success factors for the way to establish and operate the platform efficiently and effectively through case studies of the four types of web-based platforms. Findings Sharing of DRR technology through a web-based platform among Asia-Pacific countries is necessary in order to equip all parties with essential technology to mitigate intensifying disasters, to overcome the barriers of technology sharing, to breakdown transfer issues due to language barriers, and to strengthen insufficient DRR budgets. Among the four types of web-based platforms, the architecture and governance-type platform proved to be the most effective and efficient. In addition, four principles for an efficient implementation are identified through case studies, analysis, and research. Originality/value This paper reports on the reasons why it is difficult for DRR technology sharing in the Asia and Pacific regions and suggests a web-based DRR technology-sharing platform as a solution for the region. Moreover, it substantiates that the architecture and governance platform type as the most efficient and effective evolution with four principles: develop based on end-user?s needs; take a problem-solving approach; contain interactive communication tools; and provide business opportunity.}

It allows an initial assessment and selection of technological transfer options on the base of preliminary selected important criteria. As a result, businesses can reduce the number of options that will later be subject to a more in-depth assessment, from the list of already selected ones, by choosing only those who have good potential and are in their capabilities. In this way the experts? efforts are focused and their work, concerning the selection of a transfer option in which to invest, is also significantly relieved.}

A survey-based study was conducted to establish the factors that enable and restrain the transfer and commercialization of technology from South African publicly-funded universities (transferor) to SMEs (transferee), as well as to recommend how the restraining factors could be addressed. The sample consisted of researchers and technology managers drawn from entrepreneurs and six Gauteng universities. Respondents rated each of the ten literature-derived enabling factors and ten literature- derived restraining factors to technology transfer and commercialization from universities to SMEs. Results show the top two enabling factors to be absorptive capacity of the transferee; and transferor's attitude towards TT and commercialization. The top two restraining factors are university bureaucracy and the university performance evaluation system. Measures to deal with the top four restraining factors are suggested and useful insights are provided by the research findings.}

In this study, we proposed a novel approach to extract the relationships information based on Nature Language Processing (NLP) and graph theoretic algorithm. Our method, Grammatical Relationship Graph for Triplets (GRGT), extracts three layers of information: the pairs of terms that have certain relationship, exactly what type of the relationship is, and what direct this relationship is. GRGT works on a grammatical graph obtained by parsed the sentence using Natural Language Processing. Patterns were extracted from the graph by shortest path among the words of interests. We have designed a decision tree to make the pattern matching. GRGT was applied to extract the protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) from biomedical literature, and obtained better precision than the best performing method in literature. Beyond extracting PPIs, our method could be easily extended to extracting relationship information between other bio-entities.}

On the other hand, a case example-centric classroom approach can yield a rich learning environment which fosters collaboration, communication, and self-directed exploration of the instructed principles. In previous work, we have reported on our experience in changing a graduate requirements engineering course towards using case examples based on real industry projects.

In this paper, we describe our process for composing development teams based on a pre-defined set of criteria that we have established from our experience conducting project courses since 2008 and constantly refined since. We reflect on these criteria by analyzing the team synergy and project satisfaction of participating students as well as their perspective on challenges in their teams in one concrete instance of a multi-project capstone course. Our findings show that lack of motivation, problems with interpersonal relationships and communication issues affect the less satisfied teams more than the others.}

The effect of change in the temperature, sun radiation on the P-V characteristics is observed. The change in Maximum Power Point (MPP) is observed by changing the sun radiation, temperature and other solar cell parameters such as series and shunt resistance. The graphical user interface of system enables any one to analyze the operation of PV module under different environmental conditions and manufacturing specifications. The designed models of PV module could work here as simulator. This work can find its use in implementation of different Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods, in which the PV module modelling is necessary. The proposed models can be easily interfaced with the power converter models for designing of entire PV systems. Also the parameters like fill factor and characteristic resistance which are useful for MPPT designing are estimated under varying climate conditions.}

Capstone projects particularly profit from the inclusion of an industrial partner to make the project relevant and help students acquire professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is aligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed. However, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can create friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all involved parties.Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a retrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a constructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders.Key Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised of several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The guideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical objectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify issues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other groups involved in the courses.Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively to a total of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto implicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the interaction between external stakeholders and students. Our empirical data reveals seven recurring risk themes that categorise the different risks appearing in the analysed courses. These themes can also be used to categorise mitigation strategies to address these risks proactively. Additionally, aspects not related to external stakeholders, e.g., about the interaction of the project with other courses in the study programme, have been revealed. The constructive use of the model for one course has proved helpful in identifying action alternatives and finally deciding to not include external stakeholders in the project due to the perceived cost-benefit-ratio.Implications to Practice: Our evaluation shows that the model is a viable and useful tool that allows teachers to reason about and plan the involvement of external stakeholders in a variety of course settings, and in particular in capstone projects.},

It is well-known that theoretical knowledge undergraduate students acquire during their studies needs to be complemented with practical experience; therefore, participating in university supported real life projects is a viable option for the students to get prepared for the industry. This paper reports findings from a survey applied to students who had been involved in an industry-based program meant to fulfill their graduation requirements, including the opportunity to develop a capstone project. We gathered their perceptions regarding what they learned during their studies, what they acquired in the industry-based program and what they consider useful for their current jobs. The results show that most topics are aligned between the Bachelor's degree program and the industry needs, but there is a strong separation in the cognitive levels students achieve at each stage. The paper provides insight into the needs of Computer Science students and contributes to finding ways of increasing undergraduate student satisfaction with skills acquired at university and their application in real contexts.}

This chapter examines the current and potential areas for research within REE. It first presents the current status of REE provided in universities and the REE problems reported in the literature that lead us to the potential research problems in REE. The REE teaching approaches proposed by researchers are then elaborated. The proposed approaches are mapped back to address the REE problems.

We describe the typical stages of a student project, go into detail on the challenges during the Launch Phase and provide suggestions of how instructors can help students overcome those challenges.

	abstract     = {Background: Test-driven development (TDD) is a technique that repeats short coding cycles interleaved with testing. The developer first writes a unit test for the desired functionality, followed by the necessary production code, and refactors the code. Many empirical studies neglect unique process characteristics related to TDD iterative nature. Aim: We formulate four process characteristic: sequencing, granularity, uniformity, and refactoring effort. We investigate how these characteristics impact quality and productivity in TDD and related variations. Method: We analyzed 82 data points collected from 39 professionals, each capturing the process used while performing a specific development task. We built regression models to assess the impact of process characteristics on quality and productivity. Quality was measured by functional correctness. Result: Quality and productivity improvements were primarily positively associated with the granularity and uniformity. Sequencing, the order in which test and production code are written, had no important influence. Refactoring effort was negatively associated with both outcomes. We explain the unexpected negative correlation with quality by possible prevalence of mixed refactoring. Conclusion: The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to its distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact that TDD-like processes encourage fine-grained, steady steps that improve focus and flow.}

Objective: We evaluate a set of minimal, a priori and in process skills necessary to apply TDD. We determine whether variations in external quality (i.e., number of defects) and productivity (i.e., number of features implemented) can be associated with different clusters of the TDD skillsâ set. Method: We executed a quasi-experiment involving 30 practitioners from industry. We first grouped the participants according to their TDD skillsâ set (consisting of a priori experience on programming and testing as well as in-process TDD conformance) into three levels (Low-Medium-High) using k-means clustering. We then applied ANOVA to compare the clusters in terms of external quality and productivity, and conducted post-hoc pairwise analysis. Results: We did not observe a statistically significant difference between the clusters either for external software quality (F(2,27=1.44,p=.260), or productivity (F(2,27)=3.02,p=.065). However, the analysis of the effect sizes and their confidence intervals shows that the TDD skillsâ set is a factor that could account for up to 28% of the external quality, and 38% for productivity. Conclusion: We have reason to conclude that focusing on the improvement of TDD skillsâ set investigated in this study could benefit software developers in improving their baseline productivity and the external quality of the code they produce. However, replications are needed to overcome the issues related with the statistical power of this study. We suggest practical insights for future work to investigate the phenomenon further.}

Yet, the existing reviews report few evidence supporting or refuting the effect of this development approach on test case quality. Lack of ability and skills of developers to produce sufficiently good test cases are also reported as limitations of applying test-driven development in industrial practice. Objective: We investigate the impact of test-driven development on the effectiveness of unit test cases compared to an incremental test last development in an industrial context. Method: We conducted an experiment in an industrial setting with 24 professionals. Professionals followed the two development approaches to implement the tasks. We measure unit test effectiveness in terms of mutation score. We also measure branch and method coverage of test suites to compare our results with the literature. Results: In terms of mutation score, we have found that the test cases written for a test-driven development task have a higher defect detection ability than test cases written for an incremental test-last development task. Subjects wrote test cases that cover more branches on a test-driven development task compared to the other task. However, test cases written for an incremental test-last development task cover more methods than those written for the second task. Conclusion: Our findings are different from previous studies conducted at academic settings. Professionals were able to perform more effective unit testing with test-driven development. Furthermore, we observe that the coverage measure preferred in academic studies reveal different aspects of a development approach. Our results need to be validated in larger industrial contexts.},

Most of the previous works have focused on analyzing the entire text using time-consuming methods and also many of them have used unsupervised approaches to identify the main topic of documents. However, in this paper, it is attempted to exploit the most widely-used Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) features to extract topics from web documents using a supervised approach. Hiring an interactive crawler, we firstly try to analyze HTML structures of 5000 webpages in order to identify the most widely-used HTML features. In the next step, the selected features of 1500 webpages are extracted using the same crawler. Suitable topics are given to each web document by users in a supervised learning process. A topic modeling technique is used over extracted features to build four heterogeneous webpages which are considered as one of the most challenging domains for information retrieval. Not only is the content of web documents constantly changing and new information is being added in every second, but they are written in different languages in different forms. In a 2015 research report [1], about 49 billion web pages have been indexed by Google and Bing crawlers. This shows an unprecedented growth in the volume of unstructured data in the web which has caused major problems in detection and access to relevant information. Recent trends in creating massive and unstructured web documents demonstrate the urgent need to manage the large amount of data stream or, at least, extract the most important features in order to meet today?s demands [2]. By unstructured, we mean that there are no computer- readable annotations that tell the computer the semantic meaning of the words in the text. The topic or subject category of a web document is any classifiers- C4.5, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy- which are separately adopted to train and test our data. The results of classifiers are compared and the high accurate classifier is selected. In order to examine our approach in a larger scale, a new set of 3500 web documents is evaluated using the selected classifier. Results show that the proposed system provides remarkable performance which is able to obtain 71.8% recognition rate.}

Fast forward to five years, no further studies investigated whether the questions from the software engineers at Microsoft hold for other software companies, including software-intensive companies with different primary focus (to which we refer as software-defined enterprises). Furthermore, it is not evident that the problems identified five years ago are still applicable, given the technological advances in software engineering. This paper presents a study at ING, a software-defined enterprise in banking in which over 15,000 IT staff provides in-house software solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive guide of questions for data scientists selected from the previous study at Microsoft along with our current work at ING. We replicated the original Microsoft study at ING, looking for questions that impact both software companies and software-defined enterprises and continue to impact software engineering. We also add new questions that emerged from differences in the context of the two companies and the five years gap in between. Our results show that software engineering questions for data scientists in the software-defined enterprise are largely similar to the software company, albeit with exceptions.

The lessons learned offer practical means for software companies to shift their focus from the prioritization of software features to the analysis of customers? processes and the prioritization of customers? activities. That shift can promote value for customers and uncover new service business opportunities. Accordingly, this paper provides a six-step approach to adopt the value-creation logic from the customers? perspective into the existing roadmapping process of a company.}

Without thorough understanding of the requirements from customer point of view at this stage will lead to a cascading effect later on as it would involve rework and extra cost. Hence a complete scientific management approach is needed for this stage which is known as requirement management. Requirement Management takes the accountability of not only meeting the technical specifications of the customers but also involves defining an approach to take care of any change in the requirement needed later on. In addition to that requirement management takes care of tracing back each and every functionality requirement to the final delivered output. In this paper, based on experience, tools and techniques that can be used to gather requirements for commercial software application development have been presented. The process needed for managing change requests have also been discussed. Using this approach, the author has been successful in meeting customer requirements and reducing rework effort due to less defects being injected during project life cycle.}

The costs and benefits of TD, along with the uncertainty of its interest repayment, provide leverage for software managers, but also could lead to problems such as increased costs and lower quality during maintenance if it is left unattended. Therefore, effective approaches to TD management are needed by software practitioners. As one of our series of studies on TD management, this study was originally designed to reveal the cost side of explicit TD management. The study design required applying a simple proposed TD management approach to the subject project and then collecting cost information. Not surprisingly, we observed some deviation of the actual management process from our proposed one, which provided us with an opportunity to investigate the obstacles to explicitly managing TD. We also identified some costs and cost patterns related to TD management. Based on the insights gained from this study, we further propose strategies to overcome the obstacles and improve the application of TD management in practice.}

While an over-constrained solution space may yield no satisficing solution affordably, properly defined solution spaces may enable developing solutions with high levels of affordability. Therefore, effective requirement elicitation from stakeholder needs is key to achieve a proper definition of the problem to be solved. Categorizing requirements according to predefined taxonomies is an inherent part of this activity and they are as diverse as engineering industries are. Conventional approaches, which use a designer-perspective, a contractual perspective, or a combination of both, facilitate the generation of excess facilitate the generation of excess requirements during requirements elicitation due to promoted design biases and overlaps between the different categories. In order to mitigate those problems, orthogonal, system-centric categorization methods have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, research has not measured the influence of any type of requirement taxonomy on the effectiveness in defining solution spaces of maximum size, i.e., without excess requirements with respect to a given set of stakeholder needs. In order to fill in this gap, this paper presents the results of a factorial experiment involving systems engineering practitioners that compares the effectiveness in eliciting less excess requirements of an orthogonal, system-centric categorization method versus traditional ones.}

This paper analyses the requirement engineering processes across different organizations with the aim of identifying the difficulties that are encountered in the requirement engineering processes and the gap that exists between theory and practice.

While the use of conceptual modeling in practice has been addressed, what practitioners in fact require of the visual notation of the modeling languages they use has received little attention. This work was thus motivated by the need to understand to what extent practitioners? requirements are acknowledged and accommodated by visual notation research efforts. A mixed-method study was conducted, with a survey being offered over the course of several months to LinkedIn professional groups. The requirements included in the survey were based on a leading design theory for visual notations, the Physics of Notations. After preprocessing, 104 participant responses were analyzed. Data analysis included descriptive coding and qualitative analysis of purposes for modeling and additional requirements beyond the scope of visual design. Statistical and factorial analysis was used to explore potential correlations between the importance of different requirements as perceived by practitioners and the demographic factors (e.g., domain, purpose, topics). The results indicate several correlations between demographic factors and the perceived importance of visual notation requirements, as well as differences in the perceived relative importance of different requirements for models used to communicate with modeling experts as compared to non-experts. Furthermore, the results show an evolution from trends identified in studies conducted in the previous decade. The identified correlations with practitioners? demographics reveal several research challenges that should be addressed, as well as the potential benefits of more purpose-specific tailoring of visual notation design. Furthermore, the shift in practitioner demographics as compared to those found in earlier work indicates that the research and development of conceptual modeling efforts needs to stay up-to-date with the way practitioners employ conceptual modeling.}

Its benefit in decision making is unquestionable, yet existing techniques are ineffective for realistic sets of requirements and consequently their adoption by practitioners is scarce, particularly in the fields of hardware-intensive systems. The present research proposes an Adaptive Requirements Prioritization (ARP) method that improves decision making between conflicting requirements due to its principles of multidimensionality and objective-base (the right criteria are used for any particular decision), and its usability due its principles of openness (it can be tailored according to specific project needs) and structure (requirements are grouped in subsets so that existing techniques become effective). The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation for a variety of priority dimensions and priority levels.}

We propose an approach that uses a machine learning technique to mechanize the process. With this mechanism, we can identify how each QR characteristic scatters over the document, i.e. how much in volume and in what way.

The implementation of new electrical network codes at European level requires the development of a common grid modeling exchange standard. Consequently, this requires the development of dynamic models which expose their individual and integrated physical behavior in simulations used in trade-off analyses. These analyses are of particularly importance due to the increasing number of renewable variable energy sources connected to the grid. The development of such models leads to the development of new requirements for power system studies, while ensuring interoperability, security, and privacy of the models. The use of open standards for modeling and simulation could allow the export of all the necessary model information and physical behavior to guarantee consistency between software vendors and stakeholders. This work presents a formalization of functional and non-functional requirements for new standard-compliant software tools using the System Modeling Language (SysML). This work also presents the implementation of these requirements using available information modeling and equation-based modeling standards, illustrating that standards can be combined for model exchange and co-simulation by the application of the FMI standard.}

This uses a project life-cycle approach, discussing the importance of clearly defined requirements, SME engagement, lessons learned and further work beyond the project. Current initiatives in Higher Education/Industry cooperation make this paper particularly timely and its critical analysis will provide HE institutions with guidance and advice when developing similar projects. The paper identifies resources and techniques whilst highlighting the difficulties in developing higher-level strategies to the hard-pressed SME communities. It shows the importance of persistence in this area for the initiating bodies and the benefits of building on outcomes in a coherent manner. This paper has does not analyse the most appropriate areas for project deployment or the format in which they should be provided. It does, however, provide insights into the exploitation of local implementations.}

	abstract     = {Background: A grand challenge for Requirement Engineering (RE) research is to help practitioners understand which RE methods work in what contexts and why. RE researchers recognize that for an RE method to be adopted in industry, RE practitioners should be able to evaluate the relevance of empirical studies to their practice. One possible approach to relevance evaluation is the set of perspective-based checklists proposed by Kitchenham et al. Specifically, the checklist from the practitioner's perspective seems to be a good candidate for evaluating the relevance of RE studies to RE practice. However, little is known about the applicability of this checklist to the RE field. Moreover, this checklist also requires a deeper analysis of its reliability. Aim: We propose a perspective-based checklist to the RE community that allows evaluating the relevance of experimental studies in RE from the practitioner's/consultant's viewpoint. Method: We followed an iterative design-science based approach in which we first analyzed the problems with a previously published checklist and then developed an operationalized proposal for a new checklist to counter these problems. We performed a reliability evaluation of this new checklist by having two practitioners apply the checklist on 24 papers that report experimental results on software requirements specifications' comprehensibility. Results: We report first-hand experiences of practitioners in evaluating the relevance of primary studies in RE, by using a perspective-based checklist. With respect to the reliability of the adjusted checklist, 9 of out 19 questions show an acceptable proportion of agreement (between two practitioners). Conclusions: Based on our experience, the contextualization and operationalization of a perspective-based checklist helps to make it more useful for the practitioners. However, to increase the reliability of the checklist, more reviewers and more discussion cycles are necessary.},

Four pillars of requirement engineering procedures underpin the entire software. The bricks that make up the software edifice are functional and non-functional needs. Finally, design, implementation, and testing add stories to the foundation, allowing a full software tower to be built on top of it. As a result, the foundation must be strong enough to support the remainder of the software tower. Requirement engineers have various hurdles to design successful software for this purpose. Requirement Engineering (RE) is emerging as an increasingly important discipline to promote the development of web applications, as these are designed to meet various stakeholder requirements, additional functional, information, multimedia, and usability requirements compared to traditional software applications. The requirements of software systems are a very important area in software engineering. The success of software systems depends on how it effectively meets the requirements of users. In this paper, the review of current state of requirements engineering in which requirements from users are checked analyzed with their consistency and correctness is presented, and then identifies the emerging models of requirement engineering. Firstly, the paper highlight the current activities that enable the understanding of goals and objectives for developing proposed software systems, then the focus is on the techniques for improving the precision, accuracy, and variety of requirements. Next, identification of the challenges of emerging requirement engineering models is explained. The challenges like security and global trend that posed by emerging models of the future.

On the other hand, old teaching techniques especially in the engineering education nowadays are not fulfilling the market needs [1], [2]. Engineers are required to be up to date as market requirements changes [3]. More practical teaching methods are expected to prepare fresh graduate engineers to the market [1]. These practical skills should be developed in safe environments with an economic, and more engaging ways to engineering students. With the help of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, this goal could be achieved [4]. This research aims to develop a VR game that meets these needs. This work focuses on understanding the system requirements of the VR game for engineering education using engineering ethics as a case study. Requirements investigation, understanding, and documentation are done using Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools. As a result, the system's requirements are identified with seven logical models and an initial physical model. Consequently, three entities are identified for this VR game: learners, instructor and advisor. Entities relationships also have been demarcated. Future work includes the models' validation, game prototyping, and implementation using learners and educators' feedbacks on the proposed VR game.}

Even though plenty of standard techniques exist to assess statistical significance, connecting it to practical significance is not straightforward or routinely done; indeed, only a few empirical studies in software engineering assess practical significance in a principled and systematic way. In this paper, we argue that Bayesian data analysis provides suitable tools to assess practical significance rigorously. We demonstrate our claims in a case study comparing different test techniques. The case study?s data was previously analyzed (Afzal et al., 2015) using standard techniques focusing on statistical significance. Here, we build a multilevel model of the same data, which we fit and validate using Bayesian techniques. Our method is to apply cumulative prospect theory on top of the statistical model to quantitatively connect our statistical analysis output to a practically meaningful context. This is then the basis both for assessing and arguing for practical significance. Our study demonstrates that Bayesian analysis provides a technically rigorous yet practical framework for empirical software engineering. A substantial side effect is that any uncertainty in the underlying data will be propagated through the statistical model, and its effects on practical significance are made clear. Thus, in combination with cumulative prospect theory, Bayesian analysis supports seamlessly assessing practical significance in an empirical software engineering context, thus potentially clarifying and extending the relevance of research for practitioners.}

	abstract     = {Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Pareto-based search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of non-dominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains.},

Resolving nonconformities without proper tool support is more or less random, as there are usually hundreds and thousands of configurable parameters and conformance constraints, in the context of configuring a large-scale and directly deployable system. Moreover, inter-connections among constraints and configurable parameters worsen the feasibility of manual resolving nonconformities without proper tool support. In this paper, we present an automatic approach (named as Zen-FIX) to optimally recommend solutions to resolve nonconformities using multi-objective search. Solutions recommended by Zen-FIX conform to all pre-defined constraints and are optimized in terms of maximizing the overall efficiency of an interactive product configuration process. We evaluated Zen-FIX with a real-world case study containing 52454 optimization problems, with which we evaluated seven multi-objective search algorithms. Results show that MoCell outperformed all others: CellDE, IBEA, NSGA-II, PESA2, Random, SPEA2, for most of the problems, in terms of Efficiency (a combined metric of finding optimized solutions and time performance).}

Objective In the context of PLE, providing immediate feedback on the correctness of a manual configuration step to users has a practical impact on whether a configuration process with tool support can be successfully adopted in practice. Method In an existing work, a UML-based variability modeling methodology named as SimPL and an interactive configuration process was proposed. Based on the existing work, we propose an automated, incremental and efficient conformance checking approach to ensure that the manual configuration of a variation point conforms to a set of pre-defined conformance rules specified in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). The proposed approach, named as Zen-CC, has been implemented as an integrated part of our product configuration and derivation tool: Zen-Configurator. Results The performance and scalability of Zen-CC have been evaluated with a real-world case study. Results show that Zen-CC significantly outperformed two baseline engines in terms of performance. Besides, the performance of Zen-CC remains stable during the configuration of all the 10 products of the product line and its efficiency also remains un-impacted even with the growing product complexity, which is not the case for both of the baseline engines. Conclusion The results suggest that Zen-CC performs practically well and is much more scalable than the two baseline engines and is scalable for configuring products with a larger number of variation points.}

When OCL constraints evolve regularly, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand medical rules are defined and evolve regularly. Such rules can be specified with OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with OCL. To tackle such a challenge, we propose an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA) by defining and applying four semantics-preserving refactoring operators (i.e., Context Change, Swap, Split and Merge) and three OCL quality metrics (Complexity, Coupling, and Cohesion) to measure the understandability and maintainability of OCL constraints. We evaluate SBORA along with six commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA)) by employing four case studies from different domains: healthcare (i.e., cancer registry system from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN)), Oil&Gas (i.e., subsea production systems), warehouse (i.e., handling systems), and an open source case study named SEPA. Results show: 1) IBEA achieves the best performance among all the search algorithms and 2) the refactoring approach along with IBEA can manage to reduce on average 29.25 percent Complexity and 39 percent Coupling and improve 47.75 percent Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from CRN. To further test the performance of SBORA, we also applied it to refactor an OCL constraint set specified on the UML 2.3 metamodel and we obtained positive results. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment with 96 subjects and results show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly from the perspectives of the 96 participants of the controlled experiment.}

Manual configuration of CPS product lines is error-prone and inefficient, which warrants the need for automated support of product configuration activities such as decision inference and decision ordering. A fully automated solution is often impossible for CPSs since some decisions must be made manually by configuration engineers and thus requiring an interactive and step-by-step configuration solution. Having an interactive solution with tool support in mind, we propose a search-based solution (named as Zen-DO) to support optimal ordering of configuration steps. The optimization objective has three parts: 1) minimizing overall manual configuration steps, 2) configuring most constraining decisions first, and 3) satisfying ordering dependencies among variabilities. We formulated our optimization objective as a fitness function and investigated it along with four search algorithms: Alternating Variable Method (AVM), (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Genetic Algorithm, and Random Search (a comparison baseline). Their performance is evaluated in terms of finding an optimal solution for two real-world case studies of varying complexity and results show that AVM and (1+1) EA significantly outperformed the others.}

Such evidence about QIs agreements is essential to understand relationships among QIs, identify redundant QIs, and consequently devise guidelines for SBSE researchers to select appropriate QIs for their specific contexts. To this end, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation to provide insights on commonly used QIs in the context of SBSE, by studying agreements among QIs with and without considering differences of SBSE problems and MOSAs. In addition, by defining a systematic process based on three common ways of comparing MOSAs in SBSE, we present additional observations that were automatically produced based on the results of our empirical evaluation. These observations can be used by SBSE researchers to gain a better understanding of the commonly used QIs in SBSE, in particular, regarding their agreements. Finally, based on the results, we also provide a set of guidelines for SBSE researchers to select appropriate QIs for their particular context.},

We present an in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process of transitioning from a university project to a revenue-generating startup financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of non-user-centered stakeholders. To make the research-to-product transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect to their potential for commercial impact.},

Method: We conducted an exploratory study implemented by a survey in the context of a German research project with a broad range of used mediums. Results: The main reported barriers were low expectations of usefulness, no awareness of existence, lack of resources, or inadequateness in terms of outdated material or being in an immature state.

They naturally produce information about their experiences of software practice, and the beliefs they infer from their experiences. Researchers must evaluate the quality and quantity of this information for their research. Objective To examine how concepts and methods from argumentation research can be used to study practitionersâ evidence, inference and beliefs so as to better understand and improve software practice. Method We develop a preliminary framework and preliminary methodology, and use those to identify, extract and structure practitionersâ evidence, inference and beliefs. We illustrate the application of the framework and methodology with examples from a practitioner's blog post. Result The practitioner uses (factual) stories, analogies, examples and popular opinion as evidence, and uses that evidence in defeasible reasoning to justify his beliefs and to rebut the beliefs of other practitioners. Conclusion The framework, methodology and examples could provide a foundation for software engineering researchers to develop a more sophisticated understanding of, and appreciation for, practitionersâ defeasible evidence, inference and belief. Further work needs to automate (parts of) the methodology to support larger-scale application of the methodology.}

To prevent such emerging privacy risks, mobile applications now require a request for an explicit user permission, at run-time, to get access to a device's microphone. In this paper, however, we show that current defenses are not enough. We introduce a novel approach to acoustic cross-device tracking, which does not require microphone access, but instead exploits the susceptibility of MEMS gyroscopes to acoustic vibrations at specific (ultrasonic) frequencies. Currently, no permissions are needed to access the gyroscope's data, and the gyroscope can be accessed from apps or even from a web browser. In this manner, gyroscopes in modern smartphones and smartwatches can be used as zero-permission receivers of ultrasonic signals, making cross-device tracking completely unnoticeable to users. We evaluate our approach on several mobile devices using different audio hardware, achieving 10-20bit/s transmission bandwidth at distances from 35cm to 16m in realistic attack scenarios. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures against the presented attack.}

The organizations included software development companies, financial institutions, telecommunication companies, engineering companies and educational institutions. A total of 152 out of 392 questionnaires distributed, were returned, giving a response rate of 38.8%. Furthermore, the responses were categorized into two groups (users/non-users of SDMs) and T-test analysis was performed to determine the differences between the means of the two groups. The findings indicate that SDMs are effectively used in developing mobile apps and there are significant practical differences between the users and non-users of SDMs in mobile apps development in areas of organizational size, the number of developers in the organization, years of experience, the number of applications developed and application success. The users (companies and individuals) are larger, more experienced and more productive. Furthermore, the use of SDMs in mobile apps development leads to more successful mobile apps. We conclude that SDMs are indeed worthy of use in mobile apps development.}

They focus on the assessment of the RE of a company against an external norm of best practices. A consequence is that practitioners often have to rely on an improvement approach that skips a profound problem analysis and that results in an RE approach that might be alien to the organisational needs. Objective: In recent years, we have developed an RE improvement approach (called ArtREPI) that guides a holistic RE improvement against individual goals of a company putting primary attention to the quality of the artefacts. In this paper, we aim at exploring ArtREPI?s benefits and limitations. Method: We contribute an industrial evaluation of ArtREPI by relying on a case study research. Results: Our results suggest that ArtREPI is well-suited for the establishment of an RE that reflects a specific organisational culture but to some extent at the cost of efficiency resulting from intensive discussions on a terminology that suits all involved stakeholders. Conclusions: Our results reveal first benefits and limitations, but we can also conclude the need of longitudinal and independent investigations for which we herewith lay the foundation.}

Software engineering researchers should strive to create valid theories about the uses of software-based systems, even if that leads to a multitude of theories that have narrow, overlapping scopes, are approximate, and have little explanatory power. The engineering imperative is that the predictions of software engineering theories should be consistent with actual behaviour of software-based systems, and that theories and should support assurances and explicit justification that systems will meet their requirements. Process theories are about the organisation of work and project management, and are relevant to cost and schedule requirements in software engineering. However, to directly provide evidence that software-based systems meet their main functional and non-functional requirements, software engineering researchers should focus on product theories, about the specifications, designs, code, and behaviours of software-based systems.}

Thus, in taking adoption decisions on emerging technologies such as server virtualization, the provocative question we ask is: Is server virtualization implementation in business and public organizations a worthwhile investment? The outcomes of this study clearly show the answer is YES. However, the pitfalls associated with the implementation of these technologies are capable of making future adopters skeptical. This study examined the benefits and drawbacks of server virtualization implementation in 83 South African organizations. Server virtualization implementation has couple of drawbacks, which should be looked into.}

Technical Debt (TD) refers to technical decisions on shortcuts and workarounds taken during the software development. It affects the internal quality of software. Therefore, software maintenance can be difficult when the TD is not perceived or managed in the projects. Despite the increasing attention of practitioners and researchers, TD studies indicate its management (TDM) is still incipient. Particularly in Brazilian Software Organizations (BSOs), there is still a lack of information on how practitioners perceive and manage the TD in software projects. This paper reports the results of two studies aiming to investigate the current knowledge level of practitioners from BSOs regarding TD and TDM, and to produce a summary of the available technologies to manage TD. To achieve these objectives, we surveyed practitioners from BSOs and undertook a quasi-Systematic Literature Review (qSLR) to gather specific TDM technologies. The survey results indicated that the general BSOs practitioners' knowledge regarding TD and TDM is still low. Few participants from the survey reported managing TD. The qSLR results provide evidence-based information about a set of TDM technologies, synthesized in evidence briefings to facilitate their use by software practitioners in the industry. Moreover, this paper offers links to a research package to aid in the replication process and support future investigations.},

Therefore, in this study, social and organizational supports are used to understand how software developers foster beliefs regarding secure coding practices. We compiled data from 83 software developers to evaluate the technology acceptance model. Our findings show that these collective antecedents can effectively explain user belief constructs and the intention to adopt secure coding methodologies.

To tackle these shortcomings, this chapter aims to improve the understanding of the technology push process and take initial steps towards a practical methodological framework. The understanding is enhanced by creating a consolidated and unified model of the process which builds on a systematic literature review. Additionally, methods are identified, evaluated and combined into a workshop format for the most critical phase of technology application selection. A case example in a university setting shows that the workshop is well-suited to advance technologies. Both the process model and the workshop concept are relevant for the academic and practical contexts: The process model aids in better understanding the technology push process and unifies different views. The workshop is an essential first step in designing a systematic framework for practical technology push developments with concrete methods and tools. The methodology is new to the field of innovation management and forms a well-designed starting point for similar endeavors.}

Moreover, some industries need to improve their conventional control systems, so intelligent control systems are an excellent opportunity for being implemented as industrial solutions. However, when this software is transferred from universities to the industry sector, some considerations must be considered to avoid complications during the technology transfer process. This paper shows how software for intelligent control systems based on LabVIEW (ICTL) was transfer to the industry as well as the main steps that were followed to attract a market sector in the industrial automation segment. Also, this paper illustrates some experiences that were learned during the transferring process at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico.}

Our qualitative study resulted in a richer description of ESIM contents differentiated by adaptation strategies through reflexivity. Four theoretically and empirically informed ESIM adaptation strategies, i.e. reorienting, embedding, aligning and connecting, with related conditions and effects are suggested. This study retains valuable insights of prior works in Information Systems Development (ISD) research, since ESIM might be regarded as one of the latest interventions undertaken in an attempt to improve the quality of an ES product and the productivity and quality of an implementation process.}

Poor research ethics may lead to mistrust of research results, lost funding and retraction of publications. A core principle for research ethics is confidentiality, and anonymization is a standard approach to guarantee it. Many guidelines for qualitative software engineering research, and for qualitative research in general, exist, but these do not penetrate how and why to anonymize interview data. Aims: In this paper we aim to identify ethical guidelines for software engineering interview studies involving industrial practitioners. Method: By learning from previous experiences and listening to the authority of existing guidelines in the more mature field of medicine as well as in software engineering, a comprehensive set of checklists for interview studies was distilled. Results: The elements of an interview study were identified and ethical considerations and recommendations for each step were produced, in particular with respect to anonymization. Important ethical principles are: consent, beneficence, confidentiality, scientific value, researcher skill, justice, respect for law, and ethical reviews. Conclusions: The most important contribution of this study is the set of checklists for ethical interview studies. Future work is needed to refine these guidelines with respect to legal aspects and ethical boards.}

	abstract     = {Research projects in the engineering domain are often performed in partnership between academia and industry. Some kinds of funding presuppose a specific blend and participation of different partners in the projects. The initiator of a project, the prospective consortium leader, thus has to take on board a selection of organisations to meet the requirements from the funding programme or funding body. One usual way is to ask "old friends", partners you know from previous collaboration, but sometimes it is not sufficient to get a well-balanced consortium with sufficient competence and/or country representation. On the European level, there are many attempts to help proposers to build a consortium, often named "brokerage events", "proposer's days" or the like. These often seem to encourage large consortia, both in principle and in practice. Large consortia can possibly help to be more complementary and well balanced, but there is no evidence that the quality of the project performance or result is better. The encouraged process can be described as a "snowball" method. New partners arrive more or less spontaneously, and in their turn bring more partners to the consortium. Often, groups of partners who already know one another tend to join a developing consortium cluster-wise, either by country or by research or competence area. From the funding programme or funding body, consortia are also encouraged to merge with one another, which gives the process of building a consortium another level of complexity. An advantage of this model can be that partners with previous experience join the consortium, group-wise. An opposite approach is to be open, but to stay in control of the consortium-building process. This can be done by giving successive tasks and instructions to the interested partners, without any promises, and just successively incorporating new partners in the consortium. This strategy is a structured semi-open selection process for the consortium, paired with the development of the proposal. We state the hypothesis that the "standard" mechanisms might lead to large consortia, loss of control and possibly bad performance, and that a more restricted method can lead to sufficiently sized consortia, help the consortium leader to keep control, and possibly lead to better quality of performance. To learn more about this, we have interviewed a number of experienced project managers to find out how they perform consortium-building in practice. We have also been interested in learning more about how they examine new research partners before inviting them to a research cooperation proposal or project.}

Design/methodology/approach Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) was used to construct a theoretical model of partnering agility enablers, and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank and segregate the enablers into independent, autonomous, dependent and linkage zones on the basis of their driving and dependence power. Findings The study helped in identifying eight enablers that can be instrumental in driving partnering agility in higher education. According to the TISM model, clarity on roles and responsibilities of partners was found to be the most crucial and vital enabler followed by resource sharing. Practical implications The conceptual model provides a new direction on how to develop and strengthen higher education partnerships. The model has prioritized all the crucial enablers that the management can work around in order to drive partnering agility in higher education institutions. Originality/value Studies in the past have majorly focused on academia?industry partnerships. This research has tried to provide a comprehensive view of the enablers and the multidirectional interplay between the enablers that can facilitate partnerships between academia and industry, Indian and international universities, and academia and community.}

However, funding alone may not be sufficient to overcome potential differences in collaborative agendas and ways of working. As a result, positive research outcomes often get stuck in the valley of death, instead of ending up as successful innovations that create value. To contribute to bridging the valley of death, we investigated the importance of six agile principles for collaborative industry-academia research and innovation projects, abbreviated IPN in Norway. The study was limited to the manufacturing sector. We surveyed 124 IPN project leaders (70 from industry; 54 from academia) to evaluate the importance of the knowledge management practices associated with the six agile principles across the three project stages. The statistical analyses indicate the consistency of the agile principles throughout the project stages. This means that agile principles are relevant for IPN projects and can be used as guidelines for improvement of the knowledge management practices. Moreover, the study identifies the agile principles that are perceived as most important to use in different stages of a project. It also identifies the different perceptions of the importance of agile principles of the project leaders from industry and academia. These findings can support project leaders who are implementing agile principles to industry-academia research and innovation projects. The results from the study can also support national and federal research/innovation councils in decision-making when assessing industrial research applications.}

Objective In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, and the results are compared with the previously collected data of SPI implementation success factors. The overarching objective of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of success factors that play a positive role in SPI implementation; this will assist SPI managers in better designing and managing SPI programs. We are interested to discover if there are any differences in the success factors identified by the three research strategies used, that is, informal literature review, SLR, and interviews. Method Data were collected and analyzed using the three research strategies. For informal literature review, the snowballing technique was used. The SLR was conducted for formal literature reviews. For an empirical study, interviews were conducted with Australian SPI practitioners. Results Results show that (i) senior management commitment and (ii) staff involvement are the frequently cited common SPI success factors in all three research strategies. The results also uncover similarities and differences among the three research strategies regarding the importance of the SPI success factors: (i) SPI awareness is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and formal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.413, p?=?0.011; (ii) reviews are a frequently cited common SPI success factor in formal and informal literature reviews, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.517, p?=?0.001; and (iii) training and mentoring is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and an informal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is rs(37)?=?0.195, p?=?0.247. Conclusions The understanding of these factors can help both researchers and software development organizations in successfully planning and implementing SPI initiatives.

The high expressiveness of non-monotonic reasoning enables complex decision making by managing defaults, commonsense, preferences, recursion, and non-determinism, but it is computationally intensive. The exponential growth in the availability of streaming data on the Web has seriously hindered the applicability of state-of-the-art non-monotonic reasoners to be applied to streaming information in a scalable way. In this paper, we address the issue of scalability for nonmonotonic stream reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) - an expressive reasoning approach based on disjunctive logic Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics, by analyzing input dependency. We introduce an input dependency graph to represent the relationships between input events based on the structure of a given logical rule set. The input dependency graph allows us to dynamically configure the streaming window size in order to maximise the scalability of the non-monotonic reasoner. We conduct an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness and ability of our proposed approach in improving the scalability of disjunctive logic programming with ASP in dynamic environments.}

Methods Authors used mixed method approach (empirical analysis and interpretive structural modeling, ISM) to evaluate, model, and analyze the association between SPI inhibitors in software SMEs. Results The results from empirical analysis and ISM show that lack of management commitment, lack of resources, and lack of communication and information sharing are the key SPI inhibitors. The association of various inhibitors with SPI implementation is found statistically significant with effect size (0.42 < Ø < 0.75, P < 0.05). Also, Spearman's coefficient of correlation for rankings of SPI inhibitors is found to be moderate to high, ie, 0.601 (P = 0.01 < 0.05) for SLR and interviews; 0.794 (P = 0.00) for SLR and empirical analysis; and 0.711 (P = 0.002 < 0.01) for interviews and empirical analysis.

Commonly, the workforce requires guidance during the initial deployment, but what happens after the guidance stops? Why do not traditional improvement methods deliver the desired results? And, how do we maintain the improvements when they are realized? In response to these questions, we have combined social and organizational learning methods with Lean's continuous improvement philosophy, Kaizen, which has resulted in an IDKL model that has successfully promoted continuous learning and improvement. The IDKL has evolved through a real-life project with an industrial partner; the study employed ethnographic action research with 231 participants and had lasted for almost 3 years. The IDKL requires employees to continuously apply small improvements to the daily routines of the work-procedures. The small improvements by themselves are unobtrusive. However, the IDKL has helped the industrial partner to implant continuous improvement as a daily habit. This has led to realizing sustainable and noticeable improvements. The findings show that on average, Lead Time has dropped by 46 percent, Process Cycle Efficiency has increased by 137 percent, First-Pass Process Yield has increased by 27 percent, and Customer Satisfaction has increased by 25 percent.}

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a valuable technique for determining and monitoring the progress of a project as it indicates performance variances based on measures related to work progress, schedule and cost information. This technique requires that a set of metrics be systematically collected throughout the entire project. A consequence is that, for large and long projects, managers may encounter difficulties in interpreting all the information collected and using it for decision-making. To assist managers in this tedious task, in this paper we classify the EVM metrics distinguishing them into five conceptual classes and present an interpretation model that managers can adopt as checklist for monitoring EVM values and tracking the project?s progress.

This high-dimensional spectral information allows for pixel-level material discrimination, including applications to remotely detecting the presence of particular materials of interest within a scene. Target detection takes a spectrum (or multiple spectra) corresponding to the target material, typically laboratory-measured, field-measured, or image-derived, and uses a detection algorithm to assign a target-likelihood score to each pixel in the image. Here, we explore the tradeoff between spatial accuracy and detection accuracy by presenting the CITRUS algorithm (Cueing Image Target Regions by Unmixing Spectra), which performs target detection on local patches, or tiles. Instead of assigning a detection score to each pixel, we assign a detection score to each tile, indicating the likelihood of the target being contained within that local region; the assumption is that detecting target-containing regions will have lower false alarm rates than when detecting target-containing pixels. Through local spectral unmixing in each tile, we identify the corresponding endmembers using the MaxD algorithm. We hypothesize that for tiles containing the target material in either full-pixel or sub-pixel abundances, the target spectrum will be within - or close to, in a Euclidean sense - the simplex described by those endmembers. The resulting detection map highlights the tiles with low target-to-simplex distances, and serves as a visual cueing tool for an analyst. The ultimate application here is target-region detection in broad-area spectral imagery. The methodology is detailed in this paper, and results are shown on a ground-truthed hyperspectral dataset.}

In this article, a step-by-step assessment and improvement method for ERP implementation is proposed and applied in three companies. First, a five-stage ERP implementation model is proposed. Second, about 80 critical success factors (CSFs) from the literature are elaborated into key performance indices (KPIs), which are associated with each stage of ERP implementation by ten local ERP experts. Third, the weights of the KPIs are calculated using the DumpsterâShafer method and the evaluation of ten experts. During the implementation process, performance is measured at each stage and remedial actions are identified if the performance is below expectation. An implementation flowchart is developed based on a five-stage model and the philosophy of continuous improvement. Three action cases in Chinese manufacturing companies are conducted to illustrate the effects of the assessment model, which is also currently being used by a consulting company specialising in ERP implementation. With further evaluation by local experts, the model has the potential to serve as a guideline for ERP implementation in other countries.}

The paper starts with a systematic analysis of the reasons for persistent limitations of traditional information systems DR, specifically in coping with problems of contingency and self-referentiality. Following this critique, the principles of Grounded Design are presented. Grounded Design is applied in case studies where we reconstruct the social practices observed before and during the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts. We call these context-specific research endeavors ?design case studies.? In conducting these case studies, Grounded Design builds upon well-established research methods such as ethnographical field studies, participatory design and action research. To support the transferability of its situated findings, Grounded Design suggests documenting increasing numbers of design case studies to create an extended, comparative knowledge base. Comparing cases allows for the emergence of bottom-up concepts dealing with the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts in social practice.}

In addition, this article presents an 11th case study illustrating the processes, methods and techniques/tools in AABA for cost-effectively achieving business goals and architecture agility in a large scale WBS. All 11 case studies showed that architecture-centric design, development, and operation is key to taming technical complexity and achieving agility necessary for successful WBS big data analytics development. Our contribution is novel and important. The use of reference architectures, a design concepts catalog and architectural spikes in AABA are advancements to architecture design methods. In addition, our architecture-centric approach to DevOps was critical for achieving strategic control over continuous big data value delivery for WBS.}

Our results show that governance mechanisms are implemented differently for nonprofit platform ecosystems than for commercial platform ecosystems.

Such insights are particularly important in dynamic environments where individuals, groups, and organizations face a constant challenge to make sense of and respond to how industries undergo change, information technologies (IT) evolve, and new opportunities to transform processes and products emerge. Still, although extant research provides detailed accounts of TFR dynamics between groups, we know little about TFR dynamics in groups and about how intra- and inter-group TFRs interact during IT-enabled change. Accordingly, we report on an action research project in which we relied on TFR theory to assist organizational innovators in a rapidly growing mobile phone company, VoiceTech, during a sales force automation (SFA) project. Consistent with current TFR studies, our analyses reveal how the SFA project implicated frame incongruences between different stakeholder groups. In addition, our analyses reveal important inconsistencies in how individual groups framed the SFA project and consequential interactions between the observed inconsistencies and incongruences over time. Based on these findings, we argue that inconsistencies and incongruences in stakeholders? technological frames play equally important but quite distinct and interacting roles during IT-enabled change. As a result, we extend current TFR theory with a nuanced account of how IT-enabled change efforts implicate these two fundamental characteristics of framing processes. In conclusion, we discuss the empirical and theoretical contributions to TFR theory and highlight implications for future research and for the management of IT-enabled change in dynamic contexts.}

We conducted a series of interviews with Syrian refugees in Berlin, Germany, to collect preliminary insights. Then, we organized panel discussions at two key information systems conferences (ICIS 2016 and ECIS 2017) that involved participants from various countries. The panel discussions revealed seven key research themes: accessibility to information, availability of education and linguistic resources, admissibility to labor markets and entrepreneurship opportunities, communicability with home country, connectedness with local population, interactivity with host government, and volunteer coordination. We discuss how ICT might help to address issues related to each theme, present research questions relevant to each theme, and supply an illustration of how ICT has been employed to address an aspect of each theme. Insights gathered lead to theoretical implications and future opportunities for research in the information systems field, practical implications for different stakeholders interested in refugee integration to consider, and social implications related to refugee crisis that we cannot ignore.}

Although there are many causes of such failure, lack of clarity about the goals and benefits expected and how they are to be realized is one of the major contributors. This is particularly so in the public sector where the purpose of IS investment is not to increase profits, but to accomplish social and political goals. One way of reducing failure and wastage rates is to have ex-ante evaluation. Over the past three decades IS research has proposed a plethora of new theoretical approaches to improving ex-ante evaluation, but with a few exceptions, these have had little impact on practice. This paper presents a way to address this gap between theory and practice. It proposes a way in which managers can improve IS investment evaluation by changing perspective from a focus on traditional analytic tools towards a design attitude that seeks to develop multi-criteria IS evaluation approach based on contextual experience and prior knowledge. The proposed approach enables organizations to design and develop a value case using value dials as a common language that defines what constitutes the value of particular IS investments for a specific context. To assess its effectiveness, this approach was applied using a multilevel dialogical action research project within a Swedish public organization. The findings show that managers in this organization significantly improved the effectiveness of their evaluation of IS investments.}

	abstract     = {There is a paradox in big data adoption: a peak of hype and simultaneously an unexpectedly low deployment rate. The present multiple case study research develops a Big Data Adoption (Big2) model that helps to explain this paradox and sheds light on the ?whether?, ?why?, and ?how? questions regarding big data adoption. The Big2 model extends beyond the existing Relative Advantage and IT Fashion theories to include organizational, environmental, social variables as well as new psychological factors that are unique to big data adoption. Our analysis reveals that the outcome of big data adoption is indeterministic, which defies the implicit assumption of most simplistic ?rational-calculus? models of innovation adoption: Relative Advantage is a necessary but not sufficient condition for big data adoption. Most importantly, our study uncovered a ?Deployment Gap? and a ?Limbo Stage? where companies continuously experiment for a long time and do not proceed to deployment despite the intent to adopt big data. As a result there are four big data adoption categories: Not adopting, Experimented but Not Adopting, Not Yet Deployed, Deployed. Our Big2 model contributes to provide a Paradigm Shift and Complexity Tolerance perspective to understand the ?why? in each of the 4 adoption categories. This study further identifies 9 complexity tolerance strategies to help narrow the Deployment Gap but also shows that big data is not for everyone.}

The managers in charge of the initiative engaged us as they faced considerable skepticism and push-back from the organization. To help the firm embrace new innovation norms and practices, we therefore infused innovation theory and options thinking into the group of managers as a means to conceive of and implement generative capability. As a result, we present and validate an integrative theoretical model of how incumbent firms may leverage digital options thinking to shape their organizational and technological resources into requisite generative capability. In conclusion, we discuss the contributions of the model and the empirical results to extant literature on generative capability in digital innovation.},

In globally distributed software projects the development and testing are often scattered across multiple locations forming virtual teams. Further, the distributed projects are so complex that none of team members can possibly possess all the knowledge about the project individually. During testing in such teams, developers and testers need to coordinate and communicate frequently. However, coordination is affected by the availability of the project information, which is distributed among different project members and organizational structures. Many companies are facing decisions about how to apply agile methods in their distributed projects. These companies are often motivated by the opportunities of solving the coordination and communication difficulties associated with global software development. In this paper we investigate the communication between testers and developers in two teams from two software companies performing continuous agile testing in a distributed setting. We describe four communication practices used by the team: handover through issue tracker system, formal meetings, written communication and coordination by mutual adjustment. We also discuss communication between testers and developers in collocated versus distributed testers and developers. We have found that early participation of the testers is very important to the success of the handover between testers and developers. The communication between developers and testers is not sufficiently effective through written communication and that it changes depending on the type of the tasks and experience of the testers.},

Nevertheless, business cases are often poorly linked to value creation activities and organizations struggle to develop business cases that are useful and express more than simple cost savings. This action research study seeks to improve the usefulness of business cases in IS projects. We used collaborative action research with Danish municipalities to improve their practices when developing and using business cases and to change their perceptions of what constitutes a good business case that is useful during implementation and value creation. This article presents lessons learned from our action research, lessons that we incorporated into a business case method and subsequently evaluated with IS managers. There are three lessons on (1) improving the content of business cases, (2) how to develop business cases, and (3) the use of business cases in subsequent value creation. These lessons summarize our findings and the contributions are that we in the business case method propose to (1) include minimal contents, (2) develop social commitment, and (3) structure for dynamic use during value creation. We discuss the lessons and contributions related to research on IS business cases and value creation.}

While these practices have been widely adopted in small-scale, they have shown to be challenging to adopt in large-scale, system development. This is often due to a distance between customer and developer in large scale systems, and the need to break down value from the whole system into manageable parts. The notion of value is fun- damental for agile methods, especially for practices such as continuous delivery to the customer. However, how value should be handled in devel- opment practices is not clearly understood. In this paper, we investigate how the notion of adding value in every sprint has been perceived in a large-scale system development. Based on an exploratory qualitative case study, the outcome shows that it is perceived beneficial by practitioners although it comes at a price and challenges exist.}

In such ecosystem context, platform API fitness for application development has a huge impact on the success of the ecosystem. However, software ecosystems are usually evolving at a high pace given their dynamic structure and the continuously changing business strategies of ecosystem actors. The design of APIs for software ecosystems therefore has to co-evolve.

However, there is no thoroughly documented evaluation of ISR based on primary data. That is, existing evaluations are based on reconstructions of prior studies conducted for other purposes.

In this paper, we present an evaluation consisting of empirical experiences based on primary data. We have systematically collected experiences from a three?year research project and we present ting of both strengths and weaknesses are presented. The main strengths are: the bridging of the contextual environment with the design science activities and the rigorousness of testing IT artefacts. The main weaknesses are: imbalance in support for making contributions to both theory and practice, and ambiguity concerning the practitioners? role in design and evaluation of artefacts. We claim that the identified weaknesses can be used for further development of frameworks or methods concerning design science research.}

We demonstrate six interrelated complexity properties of a viable EE: a large number of self-organized agents, nonlinear interactions, (in)sensitivity to initial conditions, adaptation to the environment, emergence of successful entrepreneurial firms, and coevolution. Moreover, the integration of these six complexity properties offers an overarching understanding of how the Zhongguancun EE maintained its viability over time.

The main ambition with action research is being able to solve organisational problems through intervention and to contribute to scientific knowledge. The main emphasis has so far been on the ?research part?. Here the authors focus on the ?action part? of action research to generate rigorous research, to solve local problems and to deal with evident dilemmas in action research. Design/methodology/approach This is a qualitative case study. The empirical illustrations of this paper originate from an action research project that focused the two e-service development initiatives analysed below. The analysis is structured using key aspects and phases proposed by Avison et al. (2001). As a result of the analysis, the concept of action is elaborated. The action elements action, actor, motive, space and time are analysed together with different roles. This goes beyond the existing action research literature. Findings The conclusions show that there is a need to understand actions and roles within action research projects ? not separating action from research. Research is also seen as action. The practice of action research is also discussed as context-bounded interactive social action: action research as a recurrent, interactive and dynamic activity. It is also identified that the understanding of roles, actions and interaction can help handle dilemmas in action research. Research Limitations/implications The authors contribute to the body of knowledge concerning action research in the information systems research field and in general by exploring the need to study the concept of action (e.g. situations and elements), to be explicit concerning the different phases, roles and responsibilities and management of different dilemmas in action research. A limitation of this study is that the inter-organisational development character in this study adds an extra dimension into the practice of actions research only partially highlighted. Another limitation is focus on public agencies. However, this is not critical for the results on action elements and the action research dilemmas that are studied. Practical Implications The understanding of roles, actions and interaction can solve the dilemmas and challenges linked to the practice of action research in the information systems field, but such understanding can help discover and handle dilemmas in action research. Originality/value The originality in this research is an illustration of and a perspective of action research as a context-bounded interactive social action: action research as a recurrent, interactive and dynamic activity.

On that account, this paper examines why governing data is difficult in local government organizations. Based on a literature review and an empirical case study, we establish the inherent challenges and build on the notion of collective action to theorize the problem of data governance. Following an engaged scholarship approach, we collect empirical material through six group interviews with 34 representatives from 13 different Danish municipalities. We extend existing data governance research with our problem triangle that identifies and explicates the complex relations between six distinct challenges: value, collaboration, capabilities, overview, practices, and politics. We demonstrate the value in theorizing data governance as a collective action problem and argue for the necessity of ensuring researchers and practitioners achieve a common understanding of the inherent challenges, as a first step towards developing data governance solutions that are viable in practice.}

Although extant theory acknowledges the political nature of these dynamic transformation initiatives, researchers have yet to empirically investigate and theorize how organizational politics impacts BPT behaviors and outcomes. Drawing on a pluralist methodology, we present an embedded case study of a company-wide BPT project across four business units at the high-tech firm Terma. First, we apply different perspectives on organizational politics to develop detailed accounts of each business unit's response to the transformation initiative, which reveals four distinct patterns of BPT politics: ?applying the hammer?, ?struggling to engage?, ?walking the talk?, and ?keeping up appearances?. Next, we combine the empirical findings with extant literature to theorize how transformation agents and process users engage in politics during BPT implementation. As a result, our research leverages a pluralist approach to show how alternative political perspectives and forms of politics can help managers maneuver BPT initiatives in their roles as transformation agents and process users.}

Finally, the role of patients, not only as consumers but also producers of healthcare, is a rather formidable and complex cultural change to be addressed.}

Furthermore, usability and UX methods originate from a time when almost all software developments followed a traditional approach, such as the waterfall model. These two facts entail that existing methods often are too resource demanding and complex to apply directly into today?s agile, industrial environments. In this paper we make the claim that methods must be updated and tailored in order to be applicable within the agile, industrial development framework of today. We pursue a solution to simplify well-known methods and to train software developers to perform the UX work. To do this, three methods are modified via an iterative process together with the development of supporting materials. Software developers in three companies are trained in the methods to assess the approach. We find that it indeed is feasible to update and tailor existing usability and UX methods to fit into an agile, industrial environment. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to train developers to perform the usability and UX methods via one-day, in-situ sessions using an ?instructor?-teaching approach. The training is based on hands-on exercises and real-life tasks. This further boosts the developers? confidence in performing UX work and promises a better consideration of UX in the development phases. We evaluate our approach through observations of the developers performing the UX tasks on their own at a later point in time.}

On this basis, we present an engaged approach to formulating IS problems with, not for, IS practitioners. We have come to understand engaged problem formulation as joint researching and as the defining of contemporary and complex problems by researchers and those practitioners who experience and know these problems. We used this approach in investigating IS management in Danish municipalities. In this paper, we present the approach to formulating problems in an engaged way.

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative narrative data accrued from open-ended questions within a structured questionnaire survey are analysed using frequency, quantitative content analysis, and graphical methods. A model of the RI/TG interface is presented and discussed. Findings Principal RI enablers are ?facilitation? (industry engagement, time); while principal constraints include ?internal factors? (the academic, the university) and ?external factors? (collaboration, funding). Respective TG enablers are ?resources? (competence, time, funding) and corresponding challenges include ?external factors? (market forces, compliance). RI is considered a minor challenge to TG. Research limitations/implications The study adds empirical evidence to the ongoing RI debate within the UK generally and with regard to the CMR discipline more specifically. Originality/value RI research is relatively sparse, while the findings in regard to CMR are entirely novel.}

Limited research has investigated the management that ties the agility of individual projects with the company agility characterizing fast-moving organizations.

The study maps central problems in the ISD management to direct improvements of agility. Our following intervention ad-dressed method improvements in defining types of ISD by customer relations and integrating the method with the task management tool used by the organization. The paper discusses how the action research contributes to our understanding of ISD agility in fast-moving software organizations with a framework for mapping and evaluating improvements of agility.

From this distinction, three guidelines are presented to allow Information Systems (IS) researchers to identify appropriate research problems for DSR, namely (1) when the pre- scriptive aspect of the research problem is less mature than the analytical, explanatory, or predictive aspect, (2) when an opportunity arises to engage with a class of design problems where effective existing solutions do not yet exist, (3) when important elements of a system may only become visible through the act of design.

Although the IS discipline has extensive experience with digitalization and designing sociotechnical artifacts, the underlying design knowledge is seldom systematically accumulated across different settings and projects, and thus cannot be transferred and reused in new contexts. Motivated by this gap in the research, we turn to the data management field, where reference models have become important sources of descriptive and prescriptive domain knowledge. To study knowledge accumulation in reference models, we analyze the revelatory and extreme case of a longitudinal DSR process involving more than 30 European companies and 15 researchers from three universities over 12 years. The insights into reference model development allow us to theorize about knowledge accumulation mechanisms from both a process perspective and an artifact perspective: First, we observe that knowledge accu­mulation occurs in stages in response to technology?s evolving roles in business (problem space) and as a result of maturing design knowledge (solution space). Second, we find that reference models act as design boundary objects; they explicate and integrate knowledge from different disciplines and allow for the development of design knowledge over time?from descriptive (conceptual) models to prescriptive (capability or maturity) ones. To cope with fundamental changes in the prob­lem space, these models require continuous updating as well as transfer/exaptation to new problem spaces. Our findings inform the IS community about the fundamental logic of knowledge accumulation in longitudinal DSR processes.}

Design/methodology/approach To address this gap, the authors reported on an action research study in which the authors collaborated with a major Mexican agribusiness, ANSA, to expand its market through value co-creation with the country?s poorest farmers. To shape the strategizing, the authors combined dynamic capability theory and options theory, and the authors used the asset hexagon framework to understand the BOP population?s needs. Findings The authors offer a detailed account of how ANSA?s management team collaborated downstream with distributors and farmers and upstream with suppliers to grow a new micro-franchise business that increases the well-being of the poorest farmers and creates additional business opportunities. The research describes how firms can strategize and implement new business ventures for co-creating value with the BOP population. The results are a process model and related propositions for strategizing value co-creation with BOP. Originality/value The authors offer new empirical insights, a grounded process model and model-related propositions on strategizing BOP options.

However, our knowledge about IT project portfolio governance practices and how interactions between different structural arrangements enable or hinder effective portfolio management is limited. Against that backdrop, we report a case study of IT project portfolio governance in a Danish municipality. Drawing on work design theory (WDT), we identify three types of governance problems?hierarchical decomposition, modularity, and complex network problems?and we uncover the network of observed governance problems in the municipality?s portfolio management practices. As a result, we offer two contributions: a detailed empirical account of IT project portfolio governance, and a demonstration of how WDT can help explain problems in IT project portfolio governance practices. In conclusion, we discuss how these results may inform future research and help organizations improve governance practices in similar contexts.}

A survey questionnaire is distributed to several academic stakeholders to investigate the impact of ERP system on academic performance within the University context. A total of 110 questionnaires was received from the key academic stakeholders to examine the relationship between the three core ERP modules i.e. the students? information module, the financial module, and human resource module. The research outcomes indicate that there is a relationship between the three modules and the academic performance. However, only students? information module and financial management module demonstrate a significant impact on academic performance, though the human resource module shows no impact on the academic performance at Sohar University. This study is a single case study approach, which might limit the findings to be generalized on other education institutes, but it gives a chance to other researchers to do multiple case studies in other Universities in the region.}

When researchers use pluralist theory building, they move between description and theory and between single and multiple perspectives through four iterative steps with specific deliverables: create perspective accounts, synthesize multiperspective account, create theory fragments, and synthesize pluralist theory. Drawing on a study that served as experiential background for developing the methodology, we offer insights into the challenges involved in using the methodology and the activities in which researchers may engage to address these challenges. In conclusion, we argue that pluralist theory building offers a novel and practically useful approach to empirically based theorizing that leverages Mingers?s pragmatic approach to pluralism (2001) and extends Lee and Baskerville?s (2003) generalization framework into a detailed iterative process with steps, deliverables, challenges, and activities.}

Despite the significance of the topic, a few works in the literature examine the subject in a systematic way. Likewise, project strategy has not yet become a first-class, widely used construct, and an integral element of current project management practices. Moreover, most of the existing ideas around project strategy focus on business and management aspects, such as the alignment of projects with corporate strategy and project success factors. Consequently, limited support is provided with respect to the implementation aspects of project strategy. The main goal of this article is to bridge this gap. Specifically, to achieve this goal, we first discuss and exemplify the significance of an explicit project strategy. Subsequently, following a relevant literature review, we put forward a methodological means, called the project strategy matrix, which can be applied to design, capture, communicate, and manage the concrete strategy of a project. Such means capitalize on and adapt Rumelt's seminal work on business strategy, in a more problem-solving-oriented approach that puts emphasis on the key challenges and constraints of projects. We employ a real-world scenario of an Information Technology project to illustrate the case, to support our argumentation and to exemplify the project strategy matrix. Moreover, based on practical experience in a number of projects using a collaborative practice research approach, we report relevant findings and provide insights on the way the project strategy matrix can be applied in the real world. Finally, we call for an intensification of research on the topic of project strategy and make concrete recommendations in this regard.},

The innovation team adapted an agile scrum process to include exploratory prototyping and manage the geographical distribution of the team members. A minimum viable product was developed that integrated functional elements of previous software tools into an end-to-end data collection, analysis and visualisation product called AimHi which uses a cloud-hosted web services approach. Field trials were conducted using the software at the Uniper, Isle of Grain power station in Kent, UK. Enhancements were made to the AimHi product which was adopted for use at the Uniper site. The product emerged from a Knwledge Transfer Partnership whci was evaluated on cmplettion by InnovateUK and awarded the highest possible ?outstanding? grade. The article illustrates how the scrum software development method was tailored for a product innovation context. Extended periods of evaluation and reflection, prototyping and requirement refinement were combined with periods of incremental feature development using sprints.

However, we know little about how such networks are designed and orchestrated in resource-scarce settings to co-create value with the different parties involved. To address this gap, we report a longitudinal case study of an emerging microfranchise network social enterprise, currently facilitated by CARE, a global humanitarian and development organization, to provide timely access to quality, affordable agricultural input and services for millions of small-scale poor farmers in Bangladesh. We draw on the orchestration of innovation network theory developed by Dhanaraj and Parkhe (2006) and the notion of network imprinting (Marquis and Tilcsik, 2013) to analyze the emerging microfranchise network in Bangladesh. As a result, we offer two types of contributions to theory and to practice. First, we offer a detailed account of how these theories are relevant and applicable to analyze and explain the emergence of microfranchise networks, and we present two key propositions to generalize to theory. Furthermore, we propose an integrated framework, combining the two theories for scholars and practitioners interested in designing innovation networks. Second, based on these empirical results and extant theory, we offer three main lessons for practitioners to advance the industry by designing and orchestrating microfranchise innovation networks in embedded contexts to achieve positive financial and social impacts.}

Data is primarily gathered from 48 practitioners, of which, 34 have completed a 12-month Design Science Research study, with the other 14 in the final stages of their journey. This unique practitioner perspective further develops the novel concept of PDSR which enables practitioners to engage with the academic community and not the other way around. Key findings show that practitioners have challenges with the practical (relevance) aspects of DSR as well as the research (rigour) aspects. Nonetheless, the analysis indicates that with a clear depiction of DSR, the gap between practice and research may not be as difficult to bridge as previously thought. However, this requires the IS community to rethink their definition of engaged scholarship from one that solely focuses on the academic as the researcher to one that also includes the practitioner.}

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications provide functionality using internet connectivity and enable centralised management of executable code resources. Multi-tenancy is an architectural pattern for sharing a single instance of executable software while isolating the data and business process serving each tenant. In a multi-tenant application, a tenant is a logical grouping of end-users who share common code, data and process instances. Multi-tenancy can cut across all the layers of an application software architecture. Conventionally, multi-tenancy is implemented as a flat structure. All tenants are treated in the same way by application software. However, large enterprises are hierarchically organised with defined boundaries between business and functional units. A SaaS solution, aimed at large enterprise users, needs to reflect these hierarchical boundaries to eliminate duplication of functional software but enforce data and business process separation. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical multi-tenancy architecture for an enterprise-scale business-to-business (B2B) cloudhosted software service application. Organisational hierarchy plays a vital role in grouping end users into tenants and subtenants in our software. A new reference architectural style for implementing hierarchical multi-tenant application is presented here for the first time. We use a case study approach to empirically evaluate the latency of this architecture in comparison to known flat multitenancy patterns. Our experimental evaluation supports the hypothesis that the hierarchical multi-tenancy approach meets the needs of our application and improves its performance.},

General project management practice has been inspired by agile software development. But in order to fully understand and to provide suggestions for future practice on how agility can be incorporated in general project management, this paper addresses how agile methods have inspired general project management practices. To answer the research question, the paper provides an analysis which compares ten characteristics of agile software development (identified in theory) and the general project management method developed by the Danish Project Half Double (PHD) initiative. The method consists of 10 leading stars (principles) and the impact, flow and leadership (IFL) method for rethinking project management. The analysis showed how general project management to a large degree has been conquered by agile methods.}

ADR arguably combines the best of Action Research with Design Science, by solving an applied problem within its contextual setting (a feature of Action Research) and drawing wider lessons or universal principles from the solution (a feature of Design Science). It argues that approaches like ADR are required to address what is a fundamentally goal-oriented (through the very definition of sustainable tourism) area of research, and bridge the academic-practitioner divide. The paper presents an ADR case study on using technology to build the eco-literacy of tourists visiting Australia?s Great Barrier Reef. This natural attraction represents a highly complex ecosystem, in an educationally challenging (underwater) environment, surrounded by political and scientific controversy. The case study involves the creation of a virtual reality interpretive game (the artefact) to illustrate the four stages of ADR, namely, Problem Formulation; Build, Intervene, Evaluate; Reflect and Learn; Formalise Learning. The case study highlights the importance of ADR?s principles of ?reciprocal shaping?, ?mutually influencing roles? and ?authentic and concurrent evaluation? to bridge the gap between practice and theory, and build impactful research that can support more sustainable tourism.}

The versatility of the ambidexterity concept allows using it to test multiple research questions from various perspectives. It explains that in the last decades, the research in organizational ambidexterity has been exponentially rising. The authors argued that the proliferation of papers represents a consolidation stage of any phenomenon. Therefore, in this development cycle, the two possibilities maybe its decline or re-focus along new lines. Although the publication pattern focused on strategic management journals, it does not mean that organizational ambidexterity is only observed in established and mature organizations? strategies. Several entrepreneurial organizations have been born (e.g., new ventures) or have rejuvenated (i.e., established ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation) by implementing and developing an organizational ambidexterity capacity. This study is motivated by the apparent unrepresentativeness of organizational ambidexterity in entrepreneurship studies. Therefore, (a) we look back to the past 15 years of published research by focusing on the contribution of organizational ambidexterity to the ?elds of management studies and entrepreneurship studies; and (b)we look forward to the research in organizational ambidexterity by inspiring the analysis of ambidexterity?s role in the current scenarios (social, economic, technological, environmental) in management and entrepreneurship studies. Based on this review and analysis, we show the underrepresentation of entrepreneurship in the published ambidexterity literature until the last decade (the 2010s). Motivated by this insight, we provoke the discussion about how the concept of ambidexterity, characterized by managing a double tension simultaneously, is a potential ingredient in the entrepreneurial decision-making process of individuals, teams, organizations, and eco-systems agents. We encourage new research lines that help refresh the analysis of ambidexterity in the entrepreneurship ?eld and re-thinking its contribution to the reconciliation process between management, innovation, and entrepreneurship ?elds. Furthermore, several implications to managers, entrepreneurial organizations, and entrepreneurs emerge from this study. Concretely, we encourage them to consider this approach as a way of thinking to face the current social, economic, and health problems that we are living in due to the COVID-19 pandemic effects.}

Technological leaps have led to paradigm shifts, and today with increased digitalization many companies are facing Industry 4.0 through disruptive technologies. Through smarter industrial solutions such as Internet of Things (IoT), interconnected machines enable continuous data production and interaction with their environment in new ways. Not only through robots, but also through all types of digital devices - which require some form of information interpretation as well as human operation and interaction. The human role in such "technology-talking" work situation will affect the decision-making and business operation processes. Also work incentives and the provision of knowledge creation will form work-training models in the industry 4.0 companies? operations. Hence, increased digitalization pushes competence development of workers and employees, and to be organized as an integrated combination of engineering knowledge and practical skills. In what way will digitalization in general and IoT in particular change industrial work and its conditions for competence development and learning? This question is asked and contextualized in two industrial cases, which represent different instances of production lines that is now undergoing industry 4.0. The findings are based on empirical data collections through interviews, observations as well as field- and meeting notes. Early results show that the advancements of digital technologies need to go hand in hand with competence development approaches. The findings show how industry 4.0 initiatives are perceived and adopted by various stakeholder groups. Interviewed managers are stressing the increased need of digitalized data and immediate decision support. As new work conditions based on software-oriented and data-driven initiatives emerge, new learning logics are needed. From these various ?pictures? of Industry 4.0 initiatives we contribute with a discussion about prerequisites and implications for competence and learning for industry 4.0 transformations.}

To develop competitive manufacturing requires employees with expert knowledge.

Blended e-learning courses on university level has been successful for supporting such competence development needs, which here is described as work- integrated e-learning, e-WIL. In this study, we explore practitioners? knowledge transformation after their participation in blended e-WIL courses that are designed with industry target content aiming for workplace transformation. Specifically, we focus on the learning efforts versus the management strategies after e-learning initiatives that have an effect on workplace transformations. The industry target courses are designed in collaboration between an industry-union-university venture of a Norwegian industry network, the Addisco union and a Swedish university. Six courses are included comprising three course subjects; Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Engineering Tools, and Robotics and Automation. Addisco was the facilitator for engaging industry-university collaboration, and stimulated co-creation between industry companies. Data was collected through a longitudinal action research project, comprising six focus group sessions with 113 industry participants during 2015 and 2018. We analysed the company management support of knowledge transformation through the course participants? experiences after the course interventions. Overall results show that most participants experience a low management support of knowledge transformation as an engine for workplace transformation, after conducting e-WIL courses. Stimulation of individual motivation and new skills gained were not promoted within the workplace structures. There seem to be a lack of individual competence plans, time for studies, business models and routines, networking and recognition of the individuals? knowledge transformation. Rather, participants claimed individual responsibilities, and motivation that drives them to competence development. We therefore argue for stronger management awareness and to develop company strategies that fully appreciate the added values and new knowledge that industry participants bring back after course participation.}

Subsequently, we tie our work around ADR and WIL to the Scandinavian school of IS-research and worker participation, by emphasizing reflective practice on both researcher and practitioner side. We demonstrate this through two empirical cases and four case episodes. Consequently, the cases highlight building, intervention, and evaluation in the areas of civic orientation and county administration. The narrative around each case focuses on ADR-activities that mediate reflection and learning through iterative cycles. Outcomes from the cases are reported as WIL-outcomes and finally, we conclude this paper by briefly suggesting two implications for future relevant research.}

To address this gap in research, we draw on an action design research approach to delineate this process by drawing on a real-world setting as well as the prevalent body of knowledge. As a result, we propose a process model including two sub-processes: (1) the BDA conversion process, which explains the steps between BDA- related investments to resources, and (2) the BDA synergy process, which delineates the step from a BDA capability towards business value realization. Via taking this holistic perspective, we go first steps towards a nascent design theory in BDA business value realization, providing a basis for future IS research.}

However, while the literature describes several cases, we still have limited knowledge about the process through which managers engage in BOP strategizing. This article provides a detailed account of how a Mexican agribusiness: Agroservicios Nacionales, SAPI de CV (ANSA) developed and implemented a BOP strategy to co-create value with its distributors and poor corn farmers. In doing so, it created a new, franchise-based business entity, AgroEstacion, to strengthen its position in the market and within the industry as a leader in BOP business practices. Drawing on Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) and Option-Driven Strategizing (ODS), we adopted action research to establish close collaboration among the firm?s top directors, a select group of its managers, designated local distributors, and the researcher. As a result, we offer an Integrated Model that firms can use to strategize BOP opportunities in a way that benefits both their business and the surrounding society. To illustrate the model, we present a detailed account of the strategizing process at ANSA, how AgroEstacion was conceived, how it was implemented, and the outcomes and experiences of the overall strategizing process. In conclusion, we draw on the empirical findings and extant theory to offer principles for application of the Integrated Model to strategize BOP}

An action research process has been employed, where faculty, administrators, and students from four MET institutions participated to understand evolving educational needs and the need for new educational approaches. Based on the outcome, a new collaborative e-learning approach was tested and evaluated with students from the MET institutions. The findings give evidence of new educational needs in MET concerning leadership, teamwork, communication, cultural awareness, and new technology applications. The results point toward how collaboration is needed to infuse new topical expertise to MET institutions and to enable students (and instructors) to increase collaboration, including the importance of socialization between students from different MET institutions; how it is possible to develop new dynamic e-learning materials to give students access to new topic expertise; and the provisions of application and analytical learning activities with an e-learning educational approach. MET institutions are under pressure to develop new educational topics and approaches. At the same time, they are experiencing resource constraints and tend to operate in isolation. The results of this study provide a route forward as to how MET institutions can come together to develop new forms of education using the latest e-learning educational methods and technologies.}

	abstract     = {Although brute-force attacks on the modulus component of the RSA algorithm are possible, increasing the key size frustrates perpetrators more. However large keys increase CPU and Memory usage. Key handling would also be a challenge. Alternative approaches for strengthening the RSA algorithm are required. In addition, verification of message sources is not a feature of the RSA algorithm. Message senders cannot be tracked. If the RSA algorithm is to be used commercially, sender verification is necessary. The two drawbacks to commercial use of the RSA algorithm are, therefore, possibilities of attacks and lack of sender verification. The DH algorithm allows secure transmission of codes over insecure public channels. Can RSA encrypted messages be ?signed? using DH generated codes? Can concatenation of DH codes and RSA encrypted messages detour brute force attacks while, at the same time, allowing message verification? We propose the design of a hybrid RSA-DH algorithm which signed encrypted messages are shared. The hybrid version satisfies most properties of good cryptosystems: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability. The results reported (CPU and memory usage) show negligible differences in the relative performance of the hybrid and ordinary versions, even when the hybrid version combines the processes of two algorithms.},

This study was embarked upon to determine the extent of involvement of researchers in Africa in south-south partnerships for generation and dissemination of horticultural technologies and innovation for development. Three out of the 14 proceedings of symposia and conferences organized by the International Society for Horticultural Science held in Africa which addressed general horticulture between 2010 and 2015 (Acta Horticulturae 911, 1007 and 1021) were purposively sampled. 227 published articles in the proceedings were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Many (42.7%) of the scientists had partnership with 2-3 people. Most (87.2%) of the lead scientists were from Africa. They partnered with other researchers from Africa only (67.0%), Africa and Europe (6.2%) and Europe only (4.9%). Intra-institutional partnership within the same country accounted for 58.2% while same country inter-institutional partnership accounted for 24.7%. Commodities of research focus were fruits (27.8%) and vegetables (17.6%) while subject matter of research was socio-economics (34.8%) and others (43.7%). There were significant relationships between researchers' involvement in partnership formation and their affiliation (?2=64.9, p=0.00), commodity of research focus (?2=24.4, p=0.02), subject matter of research (?2=24.8, p=0.00), continent of first author (?2=23.2, p=0.03), and continent of other authors (?2=284.0, p=0.00). Researchers in Africa need to network and partner more with researchers from advanced economies to boost horticultural research for development and improvement of livelihood in the continent.}

	abstract     = {The development of technology is currently growing very rapidly. The change of information and communication technology (ICT) to ubiquitous technology is inevitable. This affects the development of the world of education, where the current learning method that is being promoted by the government is a student-based learning system or known as the Student Centered Learning (SCL). ADR is one of Information systems design science research frameworks. To produce a perspective design of knowledge through four main stages: Problem Formulation, Building Intervention and Evaluation (BIE), Reflection and Learning, Formalization of Learning, ADR is a combination of Action Research (AD) with Design Science Research (DSR). In learning of programming required laboratory infrastructure that can support in terms of programming practice. Growth of learning students is not aligned with the extension of supporting infrastructure, in this case the laboratory, especially the programming laboratory. In a case study at Widyatama University, along with the change of teaching and learning system, the learning media also changed. The current learning media that is e-learning, can only support theoretical learning but not support for learning in practice. This project is done by two domains: Teaching Learning Office (TLO) as the department that responsible for current e-learning, and An informatics study center developing a virtual laboratory. At the evaluation stage, testing is qualitative for users, as well as testing in Alpha and Betha. Alpha testing is done intranet on VPL-SCM, whereas on Betha testing done internet on VPL_SCM. Conclusion is an important aspect when designing IT artifacts is the dynamics between plan design and use context, The ADR interaction focuses on researchers, practitioners and end users during the design process and is strongly collaborative-oriented, The evaluation stage in ADR is a continuous stage, so the development of IT artefac can be continuously adjusted through repeatable processes, so virtual programming laboratory can be implemented properly as a supporter of existing e-learning system.}

However, it cannot be applied in the open source (FOSS) communities, without adaptation to their particularities, especially to the specific control mechanisms developed in FOSS. FOSS communities are self-managed, and rely on consensus to reach decisions. This study proposes a PAR framework specifically tailored to FOSS communities. We successfully applied the framework to implement a set of quality assurance interventions in the Robot Operating System community. The framework we proposed is composed of three components, interventions design, democratization, and execution. We believe that this process will work for other FOSS communities too. We have learned that changing a particular aspect of a FOSS community is arduous. To achieve success the change must rally the community around it for support and attract motivated volunteers to implement the interventions.}

Problems addressed by design research are often implicit, sometimes open, and sometimes even underdeveloped. Problem-solving processes, action research and in a broader sense, engaged scholarship all encompass the explicit addressing of problems and investigation problem situations. Such a problem-orientation is to a lesser degree part of design research. In this paper, we will investigate how we can provide a better understanding of problematizing in design research; and in particular what we may learn from other approaches with a stronger problem-orientation.}

Yet, there is an increasing tendency to engage in debates on the need for a more emphatic identity. Such debates are often grounded in the questions of our contribution to praxis, disciplinary evolution and the larger socio-economic context that we thrive in. One such socio-economic context, where the information technology industry has been acknowledged to have made a notable contribution to the global arena, is India. The evolution of the Indian IT industry offers some interesting insights on the role played by and the nature of contributions from different stakeholders, including software firms, educational institutions, client firms ? especially from the developed countries, the Indian diaspora and the Government of India. We use traces of this history to understand the mutual influence of the Indian academia, chiefly in the management information systems discipline and the Indian IT industry. The four dominant roles that the information systems academia have played in shaping the industry include visioning, incubating, generating knowledge and building capacity. The time has come for us to consolidate these roles and strengthen our position by daring to cross boundaries, drawing from the intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of information systems. We call upon information systems academia, especially in developing countries like India, to engage in transdisciplinary thematic research areas, be more inclusive through membership and collaborative agenda setting and build institutions that foster interdisciplinarity.}

Much attention has been on users? involvement in IT design, while users? engagement in later further utilization of IT is less explored. This paper reports on action research (AR) that sought to stimulate local learning processes and increase the exploitation of a case-handling system. The experiment is done in a county administration where the senior management has, for some time, felt that the IT is not fully utilized. The local intervention was based on an awareness of a need to overcome defensive routines to establish communicative spaces to facilitate communication between various units with strong local identities. The AR project was carried out in three local interventions and presented as an experimental approach. We could not guarantee that the design could overcome the issues identified after the first round of interviews with senior management and department managers. The intervention process espoused various defensive routines, even some that the communicative space approach could not overcome. The outcomes from the three experiments are, therefore, mixed. The results indicate that creating communicative spaces is a viable approach to engaging users in systems development. Nevertheless, defensive routines, reluctant managers, and communities of practices hamper the development of communicative spaces.}

This website will be able to share knowledge amongst lecturers by downloading study results that have been done before. After collecting all the requirements, an application is designed using the Rapid Application Development for a limited time spent. The application is built by designing a website and applying MySQL database and PHP programming language with CodeIgniter framework 2.2.2. This website is divided into 3 parts; admins, reviewers, and researcher. Admins are able to see the whole proposal which is sent and appoint a reviewer for one of the proposals. Reviewers have some facilities to review research proposals that have been uploaded. Researchers are able to upload a research proposal.}
