 abstract = {This vision paper reflects on the nature and status of Requirements Engineering as a science, based on recent RE journal articles on methodological foundations and re- search classification such as (22). We put this discussion into the wider perspective of ongoing debates in other ar- eas, including social and natural sciences methodology, IS and design research. We propose a new categorization of the notions of validity and evaluation, and suggest a cri- terial framework inspired by work on the structure of sci- entific argument. We further outline how ontology is to be seen as a (new) scientific method for theory formation that allows for theoretical, empirical and practical validation.},

 abstract = {There are many tools and techniques readily available to support the work in requirements activities of software development processes. As a consequence, the high frequency of errors still occurring in requirements activities suggests that the misunderstanding of the relationships among key decisions is the probable reason for this. The present work presents a system dynamics model constructed to make it possible for users to better understand the relations among key decision variables in requirements activities. The model was parameterized with data taken from previous studies and from a software development company so as to run two sets of simulations with three scenarios each. Optimistic, baseline and pessimistic scenarios are created on the basis of different assumptions regarding risk factors related to requirements volatility and people turnover. We used our simulation results to foresee the effects of these risk factors on the quality and cost of work in requirements activities. Up-to-date results from the software engineering literature strongly support the simulation outcomes obtained in our research. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We discuss the design and delivery of a masters course in software requirements engineering (SRE) that is designed to overcome some of the issues that have caused the research-practice gap. By encouraging students to share their experiences in a peer learning environment, we aim to improve shared understanding between students (many of whom are current industry practitioners) and researchers (including academic staff members) to improve the potential for effective collaborations, whilst simultaneously developing the requirements engineering skill sets of the enrolled students. Feedback from students in the course is discussed and directions for the future development of the curriculum and learning strategies are given.},

@article{Damian_2006,
 abstract = {Requirements engineering is an important component of effective software engineering, yet more research is needed to demonstrate the benefits to development organizations. While the existing literature suggests that effective requirements engineering can lead to improved productivity, quality, and risk management, there is little evidence to support this. We present empirical evidence showing how requirements engineering practice relates to these claims. This evidence was collected over the course of a 30-month case study of a large software development project undergoing requirements process improvement. Our findings add to the scarce evidence on RE payoffs and, more importantly, represent an in-depth explanation of the role of requirements engineering processes in contributing to these benefits. In particular, the results of our case study show that an effective requirements process at the beginning of the project had positive outcomes throughout the project lifecycle, improving the efficacy of other project processes, ultimately leading to improvements in project negotiation, project planning, and managing feature creep, testing, defects, rework, and product quality. Finally, we consider the role collaboration had in producing the effects we observed and the implications of this work to both research and practice.},

@inproceedings{Danesh_2009,
 abstract = {The concept of decision making is an important issue that has been recognized in requirements prioritization because most projects are constrained by budget and time; therefore it is often difficult to implement all requirements that have been elicited for a system. For prioritization purposes, many approaches have been proposed so far to help the process but still it is not possible to get a real understanding of whether one approach is better. One reason for this may be that different studies are done in different contexts, measure and report different variables, and use different data sets. This makes it hard to compare different studies with each other to get an understanding of when different prioritization approaches are suitable to use. It is also important to realize that using common and similar studies for the body of knowledge in this area will not be possible. This paper presents a study designed for prioritizing of online-banking system requirements through using value-oriented framework which is based on bank business value. Three bank employees from online-banking group have participated in a survey for this study. This study demonstrates accuracy and ease of use of value-oriented framework prioritization in the banking systems by managing and prioritizing of the requirements.},

Requirements modeling using the OMG Systems Modeling Language (OMG ™ ) offers a model‐based systems engineering approach to documenting the functionality, performance, and interfacing of systems. However, to use modeling languages, there is a need to understand how the language meets the needs of the modeled system or domain. Following an initial review and evaluation of attributes of PSSs and existing approaches to modeling a PSS, this article analyzes the SysML requirements diagrams–as a technique for analyzing PSS requirements. SysML was compared against existing approaches to PSS modeling using the identified PSS attributes. Case scenarios of PSSs in the automotive industry were also applied to evaluate the use of SysML requirement diagrams. The article concludes by discussing implications of SysML for PSS researchers and managers. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 15},

@article{G_mez_2020,
 abstract = {Standardization processes and collaborative tools are becoming essential for interoperable modeling and simulation of power systems. The implementation of new electrical network codes at European level requires the development of a common grid modeling exchange standard. Consequently, this requires the development of dynamic models which expose their individual and integrated physical behavior in simulations used in trade-off analyses. These analyses are of particularly importance due to the increasing number of renewable variable energy sources connected to the grid. The development of such models leads to the development of new requirements for power system studies, while ensuring interoperability, security, and privacy of the models. The use of open standards for modeling and simulation could allow the export of all the necessary model information and physical behavior to guarantee consistency between software vendors and stakeholders. This work presents a formalization of functional and non-functional requirements for new standard-compliant software tools using the System Modeling Language (SysML). This work also presents the implementation of these requirements using available information modeling and equation-based modeling standards, illustrating that standards can be combined for model exchange and co-simulation by the application of the FMI standard.},

These interaction constraints are incrementally modeled as finite state machines with parameters. Compared with the existing techniques which synthesize either information on the values of the variables or information on sequences of method invocations, our method generates models that represent the sequence constraints of method invocations, constraints of variable value, and the relations that exist between data values and method invocations.},

Even though many practitioners and researchers agree that this change is desirable, only some concrete actions have been taken in the community so far. In this paper, we present our experience in a large number of collaborative research projects (26 projects) which have had practical (industrial) impact. These projects have been conducted in several different countries, have focused on different SE topics (e.g., testing, software maintenance, and documentation), and have spanned over different domains (e.g., embedded software, defense and telecom, robotics). We characterize the industrial needs, contributions, and impacts of the projects. Furthermore, via a participant-observation research approach, the authors analyze their diary reflections recorded during the projects and synthesize their experience into a set of seven lessons learned on how to conduct successful industry-academia collaborations. Our hope is that the evidence and experience provided by our example projects would motivate SE practitioners and researchers to engage more on collaborative projects.},

 abstract = {Software requirements are often formulated on different levels and hence they are difficult to compare to each other. To address
this issue, a model that allows for placing requirements on different levels has been developed. The model supports both abstraction
and refinement of requirements, and hence requirements can both be compared with each other and to product strategies. Comparison
between requirements will allow for prioritization of requirements, which in many cases is impossible if the requirements
are described on different abstraction levels. Comparison to product strategies will enable early and systematic acceptance
or dismissal of requirements, minimizing the risk for overloading. This paper presents an industrial evaluation of the model.
It has been evaluated in two different companies, and the experiences and findings are presented. It is concluded that the
requirements abstraction model provides helpful improvements to the industrial requirements engineering process.},

The costs and benefits of TD, along with the uncertainty of its interest repayment, provide leverage for software managers, but also could lead to problems such as increased costs and lower quality during maintenance if it is left unattended. Therefore, effective approaches to TD management are needed by software practitioners. As one of our series of studies on TD management, this study was originally designed to reveal the cost side of explicit TD management. The study design required applying a simple proposed TD management approach to the subject project and then collecting cost information. Not surprisingly, we observed some deviation of the actual management process from our proposed one, which provided us with an opportunity to investigate the obstacles to explicitly managing 1D. We also identified some costs and cost patterns related to TD management. Based on the insights gained from this study, we further propose strategies to overcome the obstacles and improve the application of TD management in practice.},

Yet, there are few empirical studies focusing on what current requirements challenges are, why they emerge and how they affect requirements engineering (RE) efforts. In the present study, we assess the cognitive, social, and complexity-based impediments to effective requirements discovery through two exploratory case studies of large, multi-party development projects. We develop a rich understanding of the requirements challenges facing these development efforts, how these challenges interact and affect the requirements engineering process and outcomes. The analyses reveal significant consistency in the primary challenges of large RE efforts and the profoundly systemic nature of requirements-related impediments.

Fundamentals of variability management and product lines have been available in the software engineering research field for several decades. Nevertheless, projects to cope with variability in practice tend to fall short of target. The reason for this gap between sound theories and poor practice, common in multiple software engineering subfields, remains unclear. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted in a large-scale software dependent multinational. The results of this case study show a number of factors that impact successful variability practice. These factors can be abstracted into general hypotheses useful for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Based on the sources of discrepancy, this research suggests a practical way to overcome the obstacles on the road towards successful variability management.},

Software product line methods are often mentioned in this context, due to the variability management aspects they propose, in order to deal with sets of related software systems. They realize the sought-after reusability. Both variability management and software product lines already have a strong presence in theoretical research for several decades, but in real-life software product line projects trying to obtain economies of scale still tend to fall short of target. The objective of this paper is to study this gap between theory and reality through an empirical case study in order to see why such gap exists, and to find a way to bridge this gap. Through analysis of the causes of failure identified by the stakeholders in the case study, the underlying problem, which is found to be located in the requirements engineering phase, is crystallized. The identification of a framework describing the problems will provide practitioners with a better focus for future endeavors in the field of software product lines, so that economies of scale can be achieved.},

Ten " call for bids " were examined from a Swedish national procurement database. From the analysis of the bids, it can be concluded that: (i) the call for bids displays a high degree of precision regarding hardware aspects, but less precision regarding software; (ii) supplier experience and competence is stressed, but rarely elaborated on in detail; and (iii) call for bids vagueness may be used as a lock-in opportunity for suppliers.

 abstract = {In this panel, we propose to figure out how requirements engineering and interaction design can be usefully combined. In particular, some people argue that scenarios/ use cases should be concrete, as in story-telling. Others argue for use of "essential" use cases as a methodological approach to interaction and user-interface design. Somewhat in the middle, it is argued that use cases should help acquiring the requirements in the first place. What should the practitioner believe and, in particular, do, in order to develop useful and usable software and systems? Software development and interaction design require different skills and different methods and are typically done by different people. Still, scenario-based design is proposed for several activities relevant for both tasks, such as requirements elicitation, software design, and interaction design. Symbolic modeling in this spirit is actually common to various fields. However, scenario-based approaches vary, especially with regard to their use, e.g., employing abstract use cases or integrating scenarios with functions and goals in a systematic design process. So, the key issue to be raised at the panel is how to combine different approaches, e.g., in scenario-based development, so that the interaction design as well as the development of the user interface and of the software internally result in an overall useful and useable system.},

 abstract = {Goal-oriented requirements engineering has been extensively studied and it certainly has a lot of appeal and potential. However, it is not (yet) in wide-spread industrial use. We conjecture as a major reason that the existing approaches are somewhat isolated and generally too complex. The latter reason makes them difficult to apply in real-world projects. Therefore, we distill the essence of goal-oriented requirements engineering and unify it in a simple and comprehensive approach. We also connect it with more common approaches like scenario based requirements engineering (including use cases). As another step towards better applicability, we define a metamodel for a modeling language that allows representing all kinds of goals and their relationships in UML style.},

@article{Karlsson_2004,
 abstract = {The world of systems engineering methods is changing as rigorous ‘off-the-shelf’ methods gain popularity. The need for configuration of such methods is increasing accordingly. In this paper, method configuration is treated as a kind of method engineering, focusing on adaptation of a base method. A meta-method based on the concepts of Configuration Packages and Configuration Templates is proposed. Configuration Packages are pre-made reusable configurations of a base method suitable for a specific characteristic of a development situation. Configuration Templates with different characteristics can be related to different Configuration Packages and used as a base for reaching a situational method efficiently. The paper presents experiences from two empirical studies in which the Method for Method Configuration was developed and validated. These studies indicate that this meta-method eases the burden of the method engineer in configuring a method for particular project characteristics. Specifically it helped in deciding what in the base method to omit and to make sure that omissions made were congruent with the overall situational method.},

The collaborative effort between industry and academia promotes improvement and innovation in technology and innovative research and enables the university to be more relevant to the industry. This article proposes a collaborative approach based on alumni influences and uses secondary data on the influences of alumni in engineering to enrich the collaboration between industry and academia. The industry and academia utilize the alumni’s potential to facilitate communication and offer their students and staff facilities. The research findings can be used by policymakers to innovate in the field of engineering and to strengthen the partnership between industry and academia in society. The model enables academia and industry to utilize the alumni strengths in enriching the collaboration; it also enhances academic research output, recruitment, fundraising, marketing, product promotion, and internship opportunities for students via alumni active participation.

 abstract = {An international standard has now been established for evaluating the quality of software products. However there is no equivalent standard for evaluating the quality of conceptual models. While a range of quality frameworks have been proposed in the literature, none of these have been widely accepted in practice and none has emerged as a potential standard. As a result, conceptual models continue to be evaluated in practice in an ad hoc way, based on common sense, subjective opinions and experience. For conceptual modelling to progress from an “art” to an engineering discipline, quality standards need to be defined, agreed and applied in practice. This paper conducts a review of research in conceptual model quality and identifies the major theoretical and practical issues which need to be addressed. We consider how conceptual model quality frameworks can be structured, how they can be developed, how they can be empirically validated and how to achieve acceptance in practice. We argue that the current proliferation of quality frameworks is counterproductive to the progress of the field, and that researchers and practitioners should work together to establish a common standard (or standards) for conceptual model quality. Finally, we describe some initial efforts towards developing a common standard for data model quality, which may provide a model for future standardisation efforts.},

In the present study software process improvement (SPI) problems in small organizations were tackled by dividing the overall effort into three subtopics: technical infrastructure, working practices, and management infrastructure. Partitioning the SPI efforts into these three subtopics makes it apparent that all of these topics do not need to be tackled in the same way but some tasks can, e.g., be outsourced. In this paper the results of an investigation into the use of the model above in requirements engineering (RE) process improvement are reported from three industrial case studies. A domain specific method was constructed independently of the utilizing companies, i.e., outsourced, and it was then used in SPI efforts in the companies to establish a solid infrastructure for basic RE in a short period of time, with limited resources, and without previous expertise in RE. It is argued that the suggested partitioning can both lower the threshold for initiating software process improvement efforts in industry and increase the likelihood of successfully completing them.},

However, analysis of early aspects is hard because stakeholders are often vague about the concepts involved, and may use different vocabularies to express their concerns. In this paper, we present a rigorous approach to conceptual analysis of stakeholder concerns. We make use of the repertory grid technique to identify terminological interference between stakeholders' descriptions of their goals, and formal concept analysis to uncover conflicts and trade-offs between these goals. We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to the goal models commonly used in requirements analysis, resulting in the clarification and elaboration of early aspects. Preliminary qualitative evaluation indicates that the approach can be readily adopted in existing requirements analysis processes, and can yield significant insights into crosscutting concerns in the problem domain.},

This study reports an exploratory case study investigating the hypothesis that 'soft systems approach would identify all the flaws in requirements practices and suggest improvements suited to an organisation's context'. The authors analysed problematic requirements practices in an ongoing software-intensive socio-technical project, modelled potential changes and asked the project team to assess the organisational fit of these changes. The authors further monitored the requirements engineering improvements that the project team made according to the case study. The authors conclude that SSM could indeed uncover a relatively complete set of flaws in requirements practices. Although not all suggested changes were regarded as necessary, the implemented changes had contributed positively to the organisation's requirements engineering improvements.},

The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia.

Thus, requirements engineering is generally thought of as the most critical and complex process within the development of embedded systems. Over the years, a lot of requirements engineering research has been carried out and reported, but still it seems clear that the industry is struggling with requirements engineering. Why is that, and what should be done to support the industry in tackling its problems? Develop a new method, tailor the existing ones, or better inform the industry of what is available that could help them in their problems? To find some answers, we carried out an inventory of the available requirements engineering technologies, while also looking into their support for requirements engineering. This paper describes the survey and reports our findings indicating that what is most urgently needed is information and evidence of the applicability of the available technologies in different situations, though further development of the technologies is also required.},

Similarly, design models should be defined taking into account goals and requirements of their users, i.e. the practitioners who daily conceive, develop and deploy applications. Neglecting stakeholders' needs can bring to lack of attention towards these engineering products (design models) while fitness to requirements can drastically increase their acceptability in the real world. This paper focuses on the domain of Communication and Interaction Intensive applications (C&II applications) by presenting a suite of two conceptual models (namely IDM and E-WOOD) belonging to a more comprehensive methodological framework addressing the analysis and design of such a kind of applications. The focus of the paper is not on the presentation of the methods but on highlighting their fitness to the requirements of the potential adopters of such methods. To this end, the overall framework has been defined on the basis of an accurate analysis of potential stakeholders' goals and requirements gained from our training experience to professional designers and from adoption of our previous conceptual methods in several real-life projects.},

Compared to traditional UML class models, these normalized models are free of ambiguities such as many-to-many, optional-to-optional or reflexive associations which cause amongst others problems at design time. FCA has the benefit of providing a partial ordering of the objects in the conceptual model based on the use cases in which they participate. The four operators of the C–K design square give a clear structure to the requirements engineering process: elaboration, verification, modification and validation. In each of these steps the FCA lattice visualization plays a pivotal role. We empirically show how the strategy works by applying it to a set of case studies and a modeling experiment in which 20 students took part.},

 abstract = {Requirements categorization is an inherent part of the requirements engineering activity. Conventional approaches use a designer perspective (requirements organized according to design needs or attributes), a contractual perspective (requirements organized according to procurement or acquisition needs), or a combination of both. Such models present several inconveniences that result in limitation of system affordability: facilitate the generation of overlapping requirements, of design-dependent requirements, and of a mix of requirements applicable to different levels of the architecture decomposition or to different products. The present research proposes a Need-based Categorization (NbC) model that is system-centric: Requirements are organized around the system. Inspired by Max-Neef's model of human needs, the proposed model supports requirement elicitation by defining only what the system does, how well, where, and what it uses to accomplish it. The model facilitates the identification of constraints that limit the solution tradespace without supporting the satisfaction of new needs, of overlapping requirements, and of requirements that are not applicable to the system. Finally, the proposed model defines requirements in subsets that are associated with value to stakeholders, thus reflecting the actual dependency nature of requirements at a given level of an architecture decomposition, which promotes holistic decisions instead of local optimizations. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Its benefit in decision making is unquestionable, yet existing techniques are ineffective for realistic sets of requirements and consequently their adoption by practitioners is scarce, particularly in the fields of hardware-intensive systems. The present research proposes an Adaptive Requirements Prioritization (ARP) method that improves decision making between conflicting requirements due to its principles of multidimensionality and objective-base (the right criteria are used for any particular decision), and its usability due its principles of openness (it can be tailored according to specific project needs) and structure (requirements are grouped in subsets so that existing techniques become effective). The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation for a variety of priority dimensions and priority levels.},

Existing research on the evaluation of such conflicts primarily seek to determine the level of conflicts between pairs of requirements.

While an over-constrained solution space may yield no satisficing solution affordably, properly defined solution spaces may enable developing solutions with high levels of affordability. Therefore, effective requirement elicitation from stakeholder needs is key to achieve a proper definition of the problem to be solved. Categorizing requirements according to predefined taxonomies is an inherent part of this activity and they are as diverse as engineering industries are. Conventional approaches, which use a designer-perspective, a contractual perspective, or a combination of both, facilitate the generation of excess facilitate the generation of excess requirements during requirements elicitation due to promoted design biases and overlaps between the different categories. In order to mitigate those problems, orthogonal, system-centric categorization methods have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, research has not measured the influence of any type of requirement taxonomy on the effectiveness in defining solution spaces of maximum size, i.e., without excess requirements with respect to a given set of stakeholder needs. In order to fill in this gap, this paper presents the results of a factorial experiment involving systems engineering practitioners that compares the effectiveness in eliciting less excess requirements of an orthogonal, system-centric categorization method versus traditional ones.},

The increasing complexity of systems makes requirements engineering activities both more important and more difficult. Model-driven engineering, in which models are the main artifact during system development, is an emergent approach that tries to address system complexity by the intense use of models. This article proposes a model-driven approach to requirements engineering based on SysML Requirements and Use Case Diagrams. The main advantages are that user requirements are graphically modeled, their relationships are explicitly mapped, and system decomposition is considered in the early system development activities. In addition, requirements traceability is enhanced by using the SysML Requirements tables. The approach is illustrated by a list of user requirements for a road traffic management system.},

As a method engineer it is essential to have conceptual constructs capable of reducing the burden of details during method configuration and thus make it possible to create a balance between precision and cost. In this paper we present the method component construct, which seems fruitful for method configuration and meta method development. Furthermore, by introducing an internal and an external view of this construct we can hide details of the method component during configuration work and connect method components to each other through use of interfaces expressing goals realized by the method components. The proposed concept and views can also be used in the process of developing tool-support for method configuration.},

In this paper, previous research is discussed in three aspects: factors affecting knowledge transfer and sharing, methods to implement knowledge transfer and sharing, and the design of a KMS. After that, the results of a recent questionnaire are analyzed. Finally, this paper discusses the sources of tacit knowledge in the personnel management aspects of software development; the knowledge and the methods of knowledge transfer and sharing in the requirements change management process based on change cause analysis; the design of a data flowchart of repositories, and a prototype structure, logical model, and functional modules of RCKM systems.

It has been recognized that the lack of intelligent support tools for flexible, reliable, and adaptable requirements engineering processes is a major issue that prevents organizations from improving their requirements engineering practices. In order to implement tools that offer intelligent support for requirements engineering processes, a web-based multitier software architecture is proposed in this paper. An intelligent support tool using this architecture can support scalable software projects and can be adapted to different requirements engineering processes. Based on this architecture we have implemented a web-based tool for the "Requirements acquisition and specification for telecommunication services" (RATS) process. It can be configured to run on a standalone computer or in an enterprise environment.},

 abstract = {Regression testing is a means to assure that a change in the software, or its execution environment, does not introduce new defects. It involves the expensive undertaking of rerunning test cases. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of test cases to execute in regression testing, however, there is no research on how to assess industrial relevance and applicability of such techniques. We conducted a systematic literature review with the following two goals: firstly, to enable researchers to design and present regression testing research with a focus on industrial relevance and applicability and secondly, to facilitate the industrial adoption of such research by addressing the attributes of concern from the practitioners’ perspective. Using a reference-based search approach, we identified 1068 papers on regression testing. We then reduced the scope to only include papers with explicit discussions about relevance and applicability (i.e. mainly studies involving industrial stakeholders). Uniquely in this literature review, practitioners were consulted at several steps to increase the likelihood of achieving our aim of identifying factors important for relevance and applicability. We have summarised the results of these consultations and an analysis of the literature in three taxonomies, which capture aspects of industrial-relevance regarding the regression testing techniques. Based on these taxonomies, we mapped 38 papers reporting the evaluation of 26 regression testing techniques in industrial settings.},

SERP-test can be utilized for direct communication in industry academia collaborations. It may also facilitate indirect communication between practitioners adopting software engineering research and researchers who are striving for industry relevance. SERP-test was constructed through a systematic and goal-oriented approach which included literature reviews and interviews with practitioners and researchers. SERP-test was evaluated through an online survey and by utilizing it in an industry–academia collaboration project. SERP-test comprises four facets along which both research contributions and practical challenges may be classified: Intervention, Scope, Effect target and Context constraints. This paper explains the available categories for each of these facets (i.e., their definitions and rationales) and presents examples of categorized entities. Several tasks may benefit from SERP-test, such as formulating research goals from a problem perspective, describing practical challenges in a researchable fashion, analyzing primary studies in a literature review, or identifying relevant points of comparison and generalization of research.},

They cannot exist apart from one another. The collaborative effort between industry and academia promotes improvement and innovation in technology and innovative research and enables the university to be more relevant to the industry. This article proposes a collaborative approach based on alumni influences and uses secondary data on the influences of alumni in engineering to enrich the collaboration between industry and academia. The industry and academia utilize the alumni’s potential to facilitate communication and offer their students and staff facilities. The research findings can be used by policymakers to innovate in the field of engineering and to strengthen the partnership between industry and academia in society. The model enables academia and industry to utilize the alumni strengths in enriching the collaboration; it also enhances academic research output, recruitment, fundraising, marketing, product promotion, and internship opportunities for students via alumni active participation. We propose some significant agendas for future work.},

The checklist serves the purpose of (a) supporting researchers and practitioners in characterizing the context in which they are working; (b) supporting researchers with a checklist to identify relevant contextual information to elicit and report during primary and secondary studies. We utilized a systematic approach for constructing the classification of context information and provided a detailed definition for each item. We collected feedback from researchers as well as practitioners. The usefulness of the checklist was perceived more positively by researchers than practitioners, though they highlighted benefits (raising awareness of the importance of context and usefulness for management). The understandability was perceived positively by both practitioners and researchers. The checklist may serve as a “meta-model”, forming the basis for specific adaptations for different research areas, and as input for researchers deciding which context information to extract in systematic reviews. The checklist may also help researchers in reporting context in research papers.},

 abstract = {Most software companies have extensive test suites and re-run parts of them continuously to ensure recent changes have no adverse effects. Since test suites are costly to execute, industry needs methods for test case prioritisation (TCP). Recently, TCP methods use machine learning (ML) to exploit the information known about the system under test (SUT) and its test cases. However, the value added by ML-based TCP methods should be critically assessed with respect to the cost of collecting the information. This paper analyses two decades of TCP research, and presents a taxonomy of 91 information attributes that have been used. The attributes are classified with respect to their information sources and the characteristics of their extraction process. Based on this taxonomy, TCP methods validated with industrial data and those applying ML are analysed in terms of information availability, attribute combination and definition of data features suitable for ML. Relying on a high number of information attributes, assuming easy access to SUT code and simplified testing environments are identified as factors that might hamper industrial applicability of ML-based TCP. The TePIA taxonomy provides a reference framework to unify terminology and evaluate alternatives considering the cost-benefit of the information attributes.},

In this chapter, we use the design science paradigm as a frame for articulating and communicating prescriptive software engineering research contributions. Design science embraces problem conceptualization, solution (or artifact) design, and validation of solution proposals, with recommendations for practice phrased as technological rules. Design science is used in related research areas, particularly information systems and management theory. We elaborate the constructs of design science for software engineering, relate them to different conceptualizations of design science, and provide examples of possible research methods. We outline how the assessment of research contributions, industry–academia communication, and theoretical knowledge building may be supported by the design science paradigm.

As each project has its own requirements and objectives, a family of processes is required in practice, in order to ensure that each project is handled appropriately. This family may be a collection of predefined processes, but can also be automatically generated by tailoring a general process to a project’s context which requires formalization and tool support to be successful. Model-driven engineering provides a formal framework for defining the models and transformations required for automated process tailoring, but various types of models must be specified and evolved, limiting the industrial adoption of this approach. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a megamodel for automated process tailoring. Megamodeling provides an integrating framework for modeling in the large, including the definition and evolution of all models and transformations required for tailoring while hiding complexity. We report the application of our approach to the software development process of Rhiscom, a small Chilean company.},

The number of companies applying MDE is still very limited. Although several case studies and reports have been published on MDE adoption in large companies, experience reports on small enterprises are still rare, despite the fact that they represent a large part of the software companies ecosystem.
In this paper we report on our practical experience in two transfer of technology projects on two small companies. In order to determine the degree of success of these projects we present some factors that have to be taken into account in transfer of technology projects. Then, we assess both projects analyzing these factors and applying some metrics to give hints about the potential productivity gains that MDE could bring. We also comment on some lessons learned. These experiences suggest that MDE has the potential to make small companies more competitive, because it enables them to build powerful automation tools at modest cost. We will also present the approach followed to train these companies in MDE, and we contribute the teaching material so that it can be used or adapted by others projects of this nature.},

However, requirements engineering research has so far barely studied practice from a customer-based perspective. Furthermore, rigorous evidence about customers' perspectives regarding requirements engineering approaches is scarce, and links between customer-based requirements engineering research and the industrial practices are necessary. This paper argues that new research is necessary to tackle the above weaknesses. Our position is that: requirements specification approaches must be validated from a customer-based perspective; the influence of customers' characteristics on the requirements engineering process must be studied in more depth; and potential customer-based improvements in practice must be assessed. We also present situations in which the results from these activities would help practitioners, propose a research agenda to execute these activities, and discuss challenges that might hinder their execution.},

 abstract = {In the context of product line engineering (PLE), providing immediate feedback on the correctness of a manual configuration step to users has a practical impact on whether a configuration process with tool support can be successfully adopted in practice. Model-based PLE has brought opportunities to enable automated product configuration and derivation for large-scale systems/software, in which models are used as the abstract specification of commonalities and variabilities of products of a product line. In our previous work, we have proposed a UML-based variability modeling methodology and an interactive configuration process. Based on these work, in this paper, we propose an automated and incremental conformance checking approach to ensure that the manual configuration to each variation point conforms to a set of pre-defined conformance rules specified in OCL. The proposed approach, called Zen-CC is implemented as a component of our product configuration and derivation tool, named as Zen-Configurator. The proposed approach is evaluated with two real-world case studies and results showed that the performance of Zen-CC is significantly better than a baseline algorithm checking all the conformance rules at each configuration step. Moreover, the performance of Zen-CC rarely varies during the configuration process, suggesting that our approach is scalable for configuring products with a large number of configuration points.},

 abstract = {Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints are typically used to provide precise semantics to the models developed with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). When OCL constraints evolve regularly, it is essential that they are easy to understand and maintain. For instance, in cancer registries, to ensure the quality of cancer data, more than one thousand regularly evolving medical rules are defined, which can be specified using the OCL. It is, therefore, important to ensure the understandability and maintainability of medical rules specified with the OCL. To tackle such a challenge, this paper proposes an automated search-based OCL constraint refactoring approach (SBORA). We evaluate SBORA along with six multi-objective search algorithms by employing four case studies from different domains. Results show that SBORA along with the best search algorithm for the problem can manage to reduce on average 29.25% Complexity and 39% Coupling and enhance 47.75% Cohesion, as compared to the original OCL constraint set from Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate SBORA with the involvement of 96 subjects and the results from the comprehension questionnaire show that the understandability and maintainability of the original constraint set can be improved significantly.},

 abstract = {Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Pareto-based search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of non-dominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains.},

 abstract = {Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are naturally complex. Manual configuration of CPS product lines is error-prone and inefficient, which warrants the need for automated support of product configuration activities such as decision inference and decision ordering. A fully automated solution is often impossible for CPSs since some decisions must be made manually by configuration engineers and thus requiring an interactive and step-by-step configuration solution. Having an interactive solution with tool support in mind, we propose a search-based solution (named as Zen-DO) to support optimal ordering of configuration steps. The optimization objective has three parts: 1) minimizing overall manual configuration steps, 2) configuring most constraining decisions first, and 3) satisfying ordering dependencies among variabilities. We formulated our optimization objective as a fitness function and investigated it along with four search algorithms: Alternating Variable Method (AVM), (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Genetic Algorithm, and Random Search (a comparison baseline). Their performance is evaluated in terms of finding an optimal solution for two real-world case studies of varying complexity and results show that AVM and (1+1) EA significantly outperformed the others.},

 abstract = {Adoption of structured reuse approaches in practice often poses multiple challenges. Research-industry collaborations are considered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties as well as to validate the applicability of scientific results. However, research cooperations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners in the context of a study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the participating companies had undertaken two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse. However, both attempts did not succeed as expected. In our study, we identified tacit assumptions that were related to the encountered difficulties and present the lessons learned from the adoption approach. Furthermore , we report strategies that helped us to overcome the skepticism caused by a previous unsuccessful guided collaboration.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application.

Objective
This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering.

Method
We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis.

Results
Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer.

Conclusion
Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.},

It can be assumed that different transfer mediums fulfill technology transfer (TT) with different levels of success and that they are impaired by different kinds of barriers. Objective: The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding about the different mediums used for TT in software engineering, and to identify barriers weakening the success of the application of such mediums. Method: We conducted an exploratory study implemented by a survey in the context of a German research project with a broad range of used mediums. Results: The main reported barriers were low expectations of usefulness, no awareness of existence, lack of resources, or inadequateness in terms of outdated material or being in an immature state. Conclusions: We interpreted our results as symptoms of a lack of a dissemination plan in the project. Further work will be needed to explore the implications for the transfer of research results (knowledge and techniques) to practice.},

Challenges identified by the majority of the study participants relate to the collaborative nature of the work: the availability and discoverability of information, communication, collaborative planning and integration with work of others. Almost all participants also addressed the advantages and disadvantages of the current "fast to the market" trend, and the toll it takes on the quality of the software that they are able to deliver and on their professional and personal satisfaction as software engineers.

This study explores various aspects relevant to innovation measurement ranging from definitions, measurement frameworks and metrics that have been proposed in literature and used in practice. A systematic literature review followed by an online questionnaire and interviews with practitioners and academics were employed to identify a comprehensive definition of innovation that can be used in software industry. The metrics for the evaluation of determinants, inputs, outputs and performance were also aggregated and categorised. Based on these findings, a conceptual model of the key measurable elements of innovation was constructed from the findings of the systematic review.

Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineering research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a SLR in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

@article{Stig_2011,
 abstract = {Premature introduction of new technologies in product development is likely to lead to both budget and schedule overruns. The assessment of when a technology is ready to be transferred from technology development to product development and production is critical for striking the right balance of short time-to-market and low risk. Previous research on internal technology transfer has mainly focused on the development of methods and tools for assessing technology readiness for major development programs in governmental agencies, revealing few cases of such implementations in technology driven industrial companies. This paper aims to provide description of experiences from using such tools at a case company and prescription on how to manage the identified challenges. The study is based on 22 semi-structured interviews, primarily with personnel from the technology and product development departments. The results indicate that the readiness assessments suggested in literature can support decisions also in industrial companies. However, adapting the tools to the internal differences between technologies is important for minimizing administrative workload and ensuring implementation readiness as opposed to just technology readiness. The strategy for their adaptation could benefit from more research on the practices of companies dealing with internal technology transfer and from the development of a framework for how to adapt the assessment process to different contexts.},

 abstract = {Despite their potential for preventing and reducing diseases, the availability of marketed probiotics with a relevant health or risk reduction claim is lagging behind. Food and pharmaceutical companies, as well as universities, are challenged to collaborate across the innovation value chain to deliver on the promises of microbiota research and development. A shared understanding of the knowledge valorization process is essential for the success of such public-private partnerships. Conceptual models enable stakeholders to discuss and understand complex processes and their corresponding activities but current models are lacking granularity in terms of activities taking place. Building upon the microbiota valorization and technology transfer cycle, this review synthesizes 32 conceptual models on knowledge valorization into a Societal Impact Value Cycle that describes relevant activities. The cycle is contextualized to the microbiota industry and 8 key points for successful innovation are highlighted. The model elucidates the importance of including unmet needs in wider society for generating socioeconomic benefits. While market and society domains contained the highest number of barriers in the probiotics industry, they were scarcely covered by the reviewed literature, highlighting their underexposure. The resulting generally applicable model aids stakeholders in outlining a thorough strategy to deliver really new and radical innovations.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application.

Objective
This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering.

Method
We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis.

Results
Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer.

Conclusion
Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.},

@article{Cuadrado_2018,
 abstract = {Meta-modelling is central to Model-Driven Engineering. Many meta-modelling notations, approaches and tools have been proposed along the years, which widely vary regarding their supported modelling features. However, current approaches tend to be closed and rigid with respect to the supported concepts and semantics. Moreover, extending the environment with features beyond those natively supported requires highly technical knowledge. This situation hampers flexibility and interoperability of meta-modelling environments. In order to alleviate this situation, we propose open meta-modelling frameworks, which can be extended and configured via meta-object protocols (MOPs). Such environments offer extension points on events like element instantiation, model loading or property access, and enable selecting particular model elements over which the extensions are to be executed. We show how MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and allow describing a wide range of meta-modelling concepts. As a proof of concept, we show and compare an implementation in the METADEPTH tool and an aspect-based implementation atop the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF). We have evaluated our approach by extending EMF and METADEPTH with modelling services not foreseen initially when they were created. The evaluation shows that MOP-based mechanisms permit extending meta-modelling frameworks in a flexible way, and are powerful enough to support the specification of a broad variety of meta-modelling features.},

Furthermore, such settings for MDE evolve over time. However, currently only the evolution of (modeling) languages, tools, and transformations is studied in research. It is not clear whether these are the only relevant changes that characterize MDE evolution in practice. In this paper we address this lack of knowledge. We first discuss possible changes and then report on a first study that demonstrates that these forms of evolution can be commonly observed in practice. To investigate the complex nature of MDE evolution in more depth, we captured the evolution of three MDE settings from practice and derive eight observations concerning reasons for MDE evolution. Based on the observations we then identify open research challenge concerning MDE evolution.},

 abstract = {In model-driven engineering (MDE), a particular MDE setting of employed languages and automated and manual activities has major impact on productivity. Furthermore, it has been observed that such MDE settings evolve over time. However, currently not much is known about this evolution and its impact on the MDE setting’s maturity, i.e., on changeability and other productivity dimensions. Research so far focuses on evolution of separate building blocks, such as (modeling-) languages, tools, or transformation, only. In this article, we address the lack of knowledge about evolution of MDE settings by investigating case studies from different companies. The first results reveal (1) that there is evolution that affects the composition of an MDE setting (structural evolution) and has the potential to strongly impact aspects, such as changeability and (2) that this structural evolution actually occurs in practice. Based on these first results, we investigated (3) whether there are cases in practice, where structural evolution already altered the risks of changeability given by the respective MDE setting. Therefore, we search and identify examples for such evolution steps on MDE settings from practice and collected six case studies on evolution histories in detail. As a result, we show in this paper that structural evolution (a) is not seldom in practice and (b) sometimes leads to the introduction of changeability risks.},

Question: What are these recurring difficulty factors that arise from research question and research design? What mechanisms produce their influence? Method: We use ideation and knowledge extraction from research experience to identify potential difficulty factors, use expert discussion to understand their mechanisms, and use concept analysis to arrange them into a taxonomy. We evaluate the result by comparatively applying it to two research efforts pursued by the same research group. Results: We find six scope factors, five problematic intervention effects factors, and seven helpful intervention (side-)effects factors.

To evaluate the efficiency of our protocol, we use a “quasi-gold standard” to compute the sensitivity and precision of the search. Result: We identified 30 studies (18 empirical) and 19 approaches to strategic alignment of SPI from 495 retrieved studies. Only three out of the 18 empirical studies were rated as high in the categories rigor and relevance, suggesting the need for a stronger validation of the approaches. Conclusion: We conclude that the lack of empirical validation indicates that the results of the existing approaches have not been adequately transferred to practitioners yet, calling for more rigorous studies on the subject.},

this end, we describe the challenges and lessons learned when assessing software architecture research that used controlled
experiments, replications, expert opinion, systematic literature reviews, observational studies, and surveys. Our research
will support the emergence of a body of knowledge consisting of the more widely-accepted and well-formed software architecture
theories.

 abstract = {Empirically based theories are generally perceived as foundational to science. However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles, 24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses, some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results, and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature of the theories used is greater than that of research in software engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is, as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details of the theories' characteristics},

 abstract = {Increased realism in software engineering experiments is often promoted as an important means to increase generalizability and industrial relevance. In this context, artificiality, e.g., the use of constructed tasks in place of realistic tasks, is seen as a threat. In this article, we examine the opposite view, that deliberately introduced artificial design elements may increase knowledge gain and enhance both generalizability and relevance. In the first part of the article, we identify and evaluate arguments and examples in favor of, and against, deliberately introducing artificiality into software engineering experiments. In the second part of the article, we summarize a content analysis of articles reporting software engineering experiments published over the ten-year period 1993-2002. The analysis reveals a striving for realism and external validity, but little awareness of for what and when, various degrees of artificiality and realism are appropriate. We conclude that an increased awareness and deliberation in these respects is essential. However, arguments in favor of artificial design elements should not be used to justify studies that are badly designed or that have research questions of low relevance.},

 abstract = {Reviews are the most common way to ensure quality in natural language (NL) requirements specifications. But with increasing size (up to 3,000 pages in the automotive domain) and complexity of the specification documents, the review task tends to be less effective. To improve the review task for large documents, one possible solution is the 'topic landscape'. The idea of this approach is to introduce a pre-classification and clustering of requirements according to topics. In a first empirical study with eight students, we analyzed the effectiveness of the topic landscape approach. During this study, we encountered a general limitation of experiments with large requirements specifications, especially in external environments like universities. Industries have a strong demand on new approaches and methods to deal with large specifications. However, there is a growing gap between the number of requirements that can be examined during an empirical study and the number of requirements required to ensure results that are valid for real requirements specifications. This paper describes the conducted empirical study in detail and shows recognized problems concerning the limits of educational environments.},

The perceptions of a total of nine practitioners from three organizational groups (developer, QA manager, project manager) were elicited and analyzed.

Three types of challenges were identified as critical, causes, and easy to handle, namely responsibility, requirements, and knowledge.

 abstract = {Introduction
Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application.

Objective
This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering.

Method
We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis.

Results
Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer.

Conclusion
Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages.},

many educators and trainers to teach object-oriented modelling. In our experience, we have noticed many subtle problems and
issues that have largely gone unnoticed in the literature. Two of the major issues are related to the CRC-card role-play as
described in the literature. Although CRC-cards are representing classes, they are also utilized as substitutes for the actual
objects during the scenario role-play. Furthermore, it is quite difficult to document or trace the scenario role-play. We
propose using Role-Play Diagrams (RPDs) to overcome these problems. Our experience so far is quite positive. Novices have
fewer problems with role-play activities when using these diagrams. Teaching and learning the new type of diagram adds only
little overhead to the overall CRC-approach. Although our improvements specifically target the teaching and learning of object-oriented
modelling, we believe that RPDs can be successfully applied in professional software development.},

This problem is frequently tackled by organizing courses in the form of capstone projects. Unfortunately, this approach requires additional resources (e.g., more tutors, external customers, etc.) what limits the potential number of participants. As a response to this problem, we propose a Scrum-centric framework that allows combining lectures and laboratory classes with a minimalistic capstone project, all within a regular SE course. The course is organized similarly to a project run according to the Scrum guidelines. The focal point of the framework is the synchronization between the content presented during lectures and laboratory classes with the capstone project iterations (sprints). We also share our experience from 2 years of conducting Software Engineering course organized according to the framework together with the results of a cross-sectional survey assessing student perceptions of the effectiveness of the approach.},
