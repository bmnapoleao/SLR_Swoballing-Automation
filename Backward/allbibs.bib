 abstract = {A general method is presented for the synthesis of the folded-configuration coupling matrix for Chebyshev or other filtering functions of the most general kind, including the fully canonical case, i.e., N prescribed finite-position transmission zeros in an Nth-degree network. The method is based on the "N+2" transversal network coupling matrix, which is able to accommodate multiple input/output couplings, as well as the direct source-load coupling needed for the fully canonical cases. Firstly, the direct method for building up the coupling matrix for the transversal network is described. A simple non-optimization process is then outlined for the conversion of the transversal matrix to the equivalent "N+2" folded-configuration coupling matrix. The folded matrix may be used directly to realize microwave bandpass filters in a variety of technologies, but some of these could require awkward-to-realize cross-couplings. This paper concludes with a description of two simple procedures for transforming the transversal and folded matrices into two novel network configurations, which enable the realization of advanced microwave bandpass filters without the need for complex inter-resonator coupling elements.},

 abstract = {In this paper, novel approaches to synthesize admittance function polynomials and canonical N+2 coupling matrices for narrowband lossy filters are presented. The methods are simpler and more general than the ones found in the literature. The polynomial synthesis approach is fully analytical and also very useful for lossless polynomial synthesis with simpler derivations. The coupling matrix synthesis method is based on a lossy transversal network model, which can also accommodate direct source to load coupling. Unlike the lossless transversal coupling matrix, the lossy coupling matrix model requires the assumption of complex J-inverters and additional resistive elements in the network. The complex J-inverter circuit model is defined and explained in detail in this paper. The lossy transversal N+2 matrix can be systematically rotated to obtain a number of practical realizations. Parallel-coupled pairs and folded lossy configurations are shown as examples. Moreover, the synthesis of novel networks with different return-loss levels at source and load is presented. A performance comparison with a predistorted filter is also included in this paper.},

Having had the complex poles and residues determined using VF, the coupling matrix can be obtained by a sequence of complex orthogonal transformations. As a side product, the unloaded Qs for each resonator will be directly obtained from the complex diagonal elements of the coupling matrix. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an ideal demonstrative example along with two practical challenging filter tuning examples, namely, an eight-pole dual-mode dielectric filter and an eight-pole dual-mode predistortion filter, are demonstrated. An excellent match between the responses of the measured data and those from the extracted coupling matrix with actual unloaded Q factors can be seen.},

The two words that best explain this phenomenon are “topology” and “technology.” Thus, this paper will cover new connections, new materials, and new processes. This paper summarizes what is new, describes the new devices, and avoids simply surveying the entire field. It is not possible to cover everything, and regrettably, some new and possibly exciting areas are omitted (such as filters fabricated using liquid crystal polymers, active element inclusion, extreme power devices used in accelerators), and others, ..., because something has to be left for the next paper! The paper does cover bandstop filters, intrinsically switched film bulk acoustic resonator, and barium-strontium-titanate filters, brand new derivations of lossy filter synthesis and dual-band filter synthesis, multimode networks, new work on optimal multiplexer (multiport network) configurations, and substrate integrated waveguide filters. In each of these areas significant new work has been recently performed and is presented in a summary format suitable for those thinking that the area of filters and multiplexers has become mature (stagnant) with nothing interesting to learn. Nothing could be further from the truth!},
